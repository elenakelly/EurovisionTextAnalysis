Song,English Lyrics
De vogels van Holland,"The birds of Holland are so musical
They already learn to twitter in their early youth
The blackbird, the thrush and the nightingale
So they can celebrate spring in Holland It's no wonder, because nowhere the puddles are so blue
As in Holland, sir
As in Holland, madam
It's no wonder, because nowhere the grass is so full of dew Are the girls so sweet, are the girls so faithfull
And that's why all the birds here are
So musical, So musical, So musical Across the whole world I've heard birds sing
To the south, to the west, to the north
In many faraway countries I've heard birds sing
They sing little songs without words The French birds sing toodledoo
Japanese birds sing toodledoo
Chinese birds sing toodledoo
But nowhere the birds sing so happily and cheerfully
As in Holland in spring in the meadow The birds of Holland are so musical
They already learn to twitter in their early youth
The blackbird, the thrush and the nightingale
So they can celebrate the spring in Holland It's no wonder, because nowhere the puddles are so blue
 As in Holland, sir
 As in Holland, madam
It's no wonder, because nowhere the grass is so full of dew Are the girls so sweet, are the girls so faithfull
And that's why all the birds here are
So musical, So musical, So musical"
Das alte Karussell,"The old carousel
It doesn't go as fast anymore
The ponies and the wagones
They don't want to get going flattering doesn't help either
And neither does putting up new boards
there is only one thing that does help:
Once in a while it has to be greased And also the old organ
It squeaks like a mouse
And sometimes it can't take it anymore
Then it just turns off The old carousel
It doesn't go as fast anymore
The phonies and the wagons
They don't want to get going The small ones and the large ones
They pull and push
And that way it goes round in circles The ponies are trotting
And pulling on the wagons
And the organ is getting young again A funny thing
This old carousel
From down to above everything is shifted
But it still goes round in a circiel The old carousel
It doesn't go as fast anymore
The ponies and the wagons
They don't want to get going The old carousel, ooh......
The old carousel"
Messieurs les noyés de la Seine,"Ye drowned men of the river Seine (1)
Open the water gates for me
I'm tired of spending my weeks
On the black paving of Puteaux (2) Ye drowned men of the river Seine
Open the water gates for me
I've been travelling so long under its woollen sky
So the wind has burnt my skin I'm married to misery forever
I've never known better than love on a stone bed
The sun for the rich, the moon for the clochards
Why playing the game, when everyone cheats? Ye drowned men of the river Seine
Open the water gates for me
I'm tired of only having for heaven
The rusty bridges of Puteaux Ye drowned men of the river Seine
I've watched the boats so much
That from Aubervilliers to Bourg-la-Reine (3)(4)
I'm carrying Paris on my back The girl I loved, never loved me
The friends I had, have all left me
I'm travelling around the world to find springtime
But since the earth is round, it might take a long time Ye drowned men of the river Seine
Open the water gates for me
 I'm tired of watching the strange appearance
Of the betrayed children of Puteaux Ye drowned men of the river Seine
Paris owes me a cradle
I'll fall asleep without love and hate
Between its arms of sand and water"
Im Wartesaal zum großen Glück,"There is a harbour
Where hardly any ship leaves from
And when one leaves
It leaves to unknown distance
And when it arrives it comes
From very far away
And someone gets off and he has crossed the sea
With a glassy load from the stars

And on the quay of the past they built
A room with a sea view
And with walls made of dreams
To avoid reality
Because they did not like it a lot

In the waiting room for great happiness
Many, many people are waiting there
They have been waiting since yesterday
For the happiness of tomorrow
Living with wishes for the day after tomorrow
And they forget that it is still today
Oh, these poor, poor people

And the watched the see
And they saw the ship, too
Just while it was leaving
To unknown distance
And on their dreams
They chased it
And they did not see him cross the sea
With a glassy load from the stars

And he passed the quay of the past
And he just went past the ones in the room
He went straightforward into reality
And then they saw him smile

In the waiting room for great happiness
Many, many people are waiting there
They have been waiting since yesterday
For the happiness of tomorrow
Living with wishes for the day after tomorrow
And they forget that it is still today
Well, these poor, poor people

And in the morning
The fishermen went out to sea
And the sky was glowing
Into unknown distance
And there he came
And their nets were empty
But then he fetched the sun out of the sea for them
And he carried it up to the stars

And it was shining far throughuot reality
And the boats were dancing in the light
Only there in the room on the quay of the past
The sun was not seen

In the waiting room for great happiness
Many, many people are waiting there
They have been waiting since yesterday
For the happiness of tomorrow
Living with wishes for the day after tomorrow
And they forget that it is still today
Well, these poor, poor people"
Le temps perdu,"Sing, carillon
The song of lost time
Sing your song to my fiery heart
I cry for the one I love Lull in the evening
My dream and my sobs
Pour in me the hope to meet him soon
Hurry up, because I'm still waiting May come the time of happiness
The time of love, which only can calm down my heart Divert the river
Into the sea that is waiting for you
Cherish in these waters all life of springtime
I will always wait for your return The hours flee slowly in the night
Every hour rings monotonously
And I'm waiting for the day, always imagining
That you will give back your love to me one day Sing, carillon
Sing for my happiness
Sing your song, so softly to my heart
Also sing for the one I love Lull in the evening
Our love embraces
Pour in me the hope to keep him forever
Sing, I forget the lost time Ring, but you don't have to hurry
The hour of love keeps us clasped Divert the river
Into the sea that is waiting for you
Cherish in these waters all life of springtime
I will always wait for your return"
Ne crois pas,"If they told you that you have a good look
There is nothing to boast about
And instead of playing the good look
You should take advantage of it Don't believe that all your life
You will be loved for your nice eyes
Because if your face makes other envious
It's because you're young and nothing better Don't believe, don't believe
That you will be always a handsome boy
Don't believe, don't believe
That your youth will last You will be like everybody
With faded colour
The belly as a globe
And all your teeth unset When you will have your skull quite smooth
Clumsy gesture
And sidelong glance
You'll go to be repaired Don't believe, don't believe
That you will always be a handsome boy
Don't believe, don't believe
That your youth will last You think you're clever
To play the unfathomable
The untouchable
From the start until never in a month of Sundays It's not serious
Hermes, Adonis, Hercules
Who stroll
Without thinking that one day they will get old If they told you that you have a good look
There is nothing to boast about
And instead of playing the good look
You should take advantage of it Don't believe that all your life
You will be loved for your nice eyes
Because if your face makes other envious
It's because you're young and nothing better Don't believe, don't believe
That you will always be a handsome boy
Don't believe, don't believe
That your youth will last Don't believe... don't believe...
Don't believe that your youth will last"
Aprite le finestre,"The first red rose has already blossomed
And sweet-smelling violets shyly come up
The first swallow is back by now
It's starting to whirl in the clear sky
It comes to announce nice weather Open your windows to the newly born sun
It's spring, it's spring
Let a little fresh air in
With the smell of gardens and flowery meadows Open your windows to new dreams
Beautiful little girls in love
It's maybe the most beautiful dream you dream
Tomorrow it will be happiness In the sky, among the silver clouds
The moon has already set a date
Open your windows to the newly born sun
It's spring, the festival of love La la la la la la la la la la la
Open your windows to the newly born sun On the window-sill a small nightingale
With tender wings and soft feathers
Has already shyly flown up
And it's started tapping on the glass
It wants to bring its most beautiful message: It's spring, it's spring Open your windows to new dreams
To hope, to illusion
Let the last song in
It will softly go down into your heart In the sky, among the silver clouds
The moon has already set a date
Open your windows to the new sun
It's spring, the festival of love La la la la la la la la la la la
Open your windows to the first love"
Voorgoed voorbij,"Over for good
Now we'll never be together again
My darling
What have I done to you? Over for good
Your windows are closed
But just like then
I still see violets The whole world smells good
The spring-flower is colouring
Ah, why is there every year a new May?
For me, it's over forever
The spring of my life
That season of mirth
It's all over For you it was just a game
I know very well that
You didn't mean it that way
But me, I did mean it
I felt it very deeply The whole world smells good
The spring-flower is colouring
Ah, why is there every year a new May?
For me, it's over forever
The spring of my life
That season of mirth
It's all over"
Refrain,"Chorus of love, or or or or
Chorus, color of the sky, fragrance of my twenties
Garden full of sunshine where I ran as a child
Everywhere, I was looking for you, my distant love
By watching the paths where you took my hand The days are gone and we have grown
Love hurt us, time healed us
But only and without spring
I run in vain, in the woods, the fields
Telling me to remember you, our love of another time The years pass, take wings
And on the roofs of my boredom, the rain flows
Where the caravel parties are
Driving my heart, supporting my dreams of your oblivion
I would agree you return like before
Take flowers in my blinds
And your youth in my home Chorus, color of the rain, regrets of my twenties
Grief, melancholy of no longer being a child
But only and far from you, by the paths where you are not
I'm mourning my love of twenty years"
Le plus beau jour de ma vie,"The bells are ringing
Everything is heralding
The most beautiful day of my life
I am getting married today
Ding dong
Ding dong If Mum cries
It will soon be time
And Dad is offering me his arm
We are going off with little steps
Ding dong
Ding dong The very small children
Are following me portly
Carrying my dress
Under my white veil
Here is my Charming Prince
He is smiling tenderly
I am approaching him
With my heart beating A short minute
Like in a dream
The two beings of us full of love
Will be united forever
Ding dong
Ding dong What a moving moment
I am feelng all dizzy
Then your hand on my hand
I simply said I do The organ is subdued
Everything is lighting up
The gate is wide open
We are leaving under the clear sky
Ding dong
Ding dong We are admired
And I hear them say
""Look, she is pretty""
How beautifully they are assembled
Ding dong
Ding dong Sweet happiness is grabbing me
While, on my hand
Your eyes are caressing
My ring of fine gold
The room of a moment
I repeat the vow
To live to
Love you faithfully The bells are ringing
Everything is heralding
That I will never forget
The most beautiful day of my life
Ding dong
Ding dong"
So geht das jede Nacht,"On Sunday with Jimmy, on Monday with Jack
On Tuesday you go off with Johnny That's how it is every night (That's how it is every night)
That's how it is every night (That's how it is every night)
I've never, never thought that of you I give you flowers and drive you to the office
Take your mother every Sunday to the zoo
But on Wednesday Billy brings you home
And on Thursday you go out with Tommy That's how it is every night (That's how it is every night)
That's how it is every night (That's how it is every night)
I've never, never thought that of you I've loved you since you were a baby
Now I've been practicing the boogie and the cha-cha-cha
But on Friday, on Friday you're dancing with Ben
Saturday with someone I don't even know That's how it is every night (That's how it is every night)
That's how it is every night (That's how it is every night)
I've never, never thought that of you But if you were thinking I've been sitting at home
I've been going out with someone else every day That's how it is every night (That's how it is every night)
That's how it is every night (That's how it is every night)
You've never, never thought that of me"
Il est là,"I can't change my life, he's there
As soon as I run away from him, he's there
Whatever I do, whatever I say
I only see his smile
Which always seems to say to me:
""I'm there, I'm there"" Clung in all my dreams, he's there
And forcing my attention unremittingly, he's there
He has the power of a devil
Who rules over his fellows
But what a wonderful power
He's there, he's there I've tried everything to forget him
I've crossed the whole world
But no man has given me
Such a part of eternity I can't change my life, he's there
As soon as I run away from him, he's there
He's extraordinary
And how he knows to please you then
No, there's nothing to do
 He's there, he's there Everywhere his eyes, everywhere his lips
I feel like I have a fever inside of me
My whole being is destroyed
And all the time I repeat to myself: I can't change my life, he's there
As soon as I run away from him, he's there
Whatever I do, whatever I say
I only see his smile
Which always seems to say to me
""I'm there, I'm there"" When I'm walking in the street, he's there
In the middle of the crush, I see him
He has a hold on me
Which frightens me and carries me away
And my desire breaks down
He's there, he's there Oh, I really tried everything
Forever able to do without
His body and his kisses
It's impossible not to love him I can't change my life, he's there
As soon as I run away from him, he's there
And until my last hour
Until my last quarter
Only one thing will remain I will see him there in front of me
He will be there forever
He's there, he's there, he's there
He's there He's there"
Les amants de minuit,"Midnight lovers, by chance meet together
By chance meet together
And, about what will follow, happiness or unfortunate
Only knows the night At the corner of two streets, at a café tables
On the avenue, two shadows had come
And then, the die is cast No pointless words, no lost kisses
No lost kisses
No difficult confessions, nor dejected heart
Nor disappointing romance At dawn no return
Lovers unlearn their names and their loves
It is quite the equal of mine, worn out by so many days. Midnight lovers, by chance meet together
By chance meet together
And, about what will followed, happiness or unfortunate
Only knows the night And if their heart gave themselves a little more than one night
There will be nobody, nobody between her and him
To shout them misdeal Midnight lovers, by chance meet together
By chance meet together"
Amami se vuoi,"I really like caressing you
Kissing your shy eyes
But I don't feel like swearing
If you ask me for eternal love Let's give ourselves up to destiny
He's the only one who can't cheat
And if I stay near you
Don't flatter yourself, but don't despair, no Love me if you want to, hold me if you can
I'm the love that fades away
But never trust my kisses
I'm the love that hurts And when you hold me softly in your arms
Even more softly, I'll say to you:
""Love me if you want to, hold me if you can
Because I'm like this"" And if I stay near you
Don't flatter yourself, but don't despair, no Love me if you want to, hold me if you can
I'm the love that fades away
But never trust my kisses
I'm the love that hurts And when you hold me softly in your arms
Even more softly, I will say to you:
""Love me if you want to, hold me if you can
Because I'm like this"""
Straatdeuntje,"Along the streets, a tune is dancing
And for a moment I stand still
Where is that pretty tune
All of a sudden coming from? It's playing in the trees
Frolicking in the wind
It can't be bridled
It's soon becoming my friend Along the streets, a tune is floating
It's as if a sunbeam
Is penetrating with that pretty tune
Into the most little portal Tralalala tralala tralalala...
Tralalala tralala tralalala... Along the streets, a tune is dancing
It's heard by young and old
Oh, how such a simple tune
Can become indispensable so quickly It knocks on the windows
Asks: ""Let me in""
I can easily whistle it
It makes me good-humoured Along the streets, a tune is floating
It follows me everywhere
And I hope that this pretty tune
Will always remain my friend Tralalala tralala tralalala...
Tralalala lalala tralalala..."
Amours mortes (Tant de peine),"Dead loves
You, that I love
You made me so much sad
How to erase
The passing days?
So much sadness
Whole days long I'm hanging around
Begging to my remembrance
A little bit from you
Your voice in a dream
I remember
Whispered unremittingly
Didn't ask nothing
You were so tender
This summer night
How to forbid myself
To not listen?
You, that I love
You made me so much sad
How to erase
The passing days?
Nobody any more
And my monotonous life
Is marking out every days
Without your love
Without you I'm shivering
Looking for your hand
In the autumn night
I'm hoping, in vain
And nevertheless really
My life inside of me
Scream to me: I only love
Only love you
You, that I love
You made me so much sad
How to erase
The passing days?
Your voice, your lips
Imprisoned my fever
But how to erase
The passing days?"
All,"All the golden dreams of yesterday
All the fragrance of a bygone May
All the words two hearts in love can say
All you'll ever mean to me, my darling

All we've shared throughout the passing years
All the laughter, all the sighs, the tears
All the joy of living, loving and forgiving
These are all to me

All the laughter, all the sighs, the tears
All the joy of living, loving and forgiving
These are all to me"
Corde della mia chitarra,"She has returned
The same things welcomed her
The same roses anticipated her
Sweet green-eyed dream
She has returned, but too late
Too late for the one who waited

Strings of my guitar
If my hand trembles on the chord
If the music gets lost
In the indifference of a glance

Strings of my guitar
Why do you stop?
Why are you silent?
You alone, to me
Ah, how lovely that music was
Ah, and how useless it seems now
If she doesn't listen to us, don't stop
Strings of my guitar
Sound for me

Strings of my guitar
Why do you stop?
Why are you silent?
You alone, to me
Ah, how lovely that music was
Ah, and how useless it seems now
If she doesn't listen to us, don't stop
Strings of my guitar
Sound for me

Sound
Sound
Strings of my guitar"
"Wohin, kleines Pony?","Where, little pony, do we want to ride to?
Where should my song accompany us today?
To your herds, the little horses?
There the valleys are immensely wide Where, little pony, do we want to ride to?
Where should my song accompany us today?
To the green pasture, there in the moorland
Where once I've kissed, at the time of roses Today is a day only for both of us
And you and me are carefree
Who else sees the world as beautiful
As beautiful as we see it? Where, little pony, do we want to ride to?
My song will truely acompany both of us
And through the fields, the wide fields
It sounds in the wind, how happy we are Today is a day only for both of us
And you and me are carefree
Who else sees the world as beautiful
As beautiful as we see it? Where, little pony, do we want to ride to?
My song will truely acompany both of us
And through the fields, the wide fields
Sounds for both of us, my herippihei"
Net als toen,"Don’t be so drowsy with that eternal paper
 Don’t yawn from sleep or boredom
 I’m your wife and I eat out of your hand
 But I don’t eat from charity Don’t look at me as if you think, “are you still alive?”
Am I still that woman
 With whom you once – when was it again?
 Wanted to have that little adventure at all costs? Be nice once again, just like then
 Ask me once again for a kiss
 Bring me roses again, blush again
 When you see me, just like then Be nice and gallant once again
 Find me beautiful and charming again
 Then the world will be just like before
 A fairyland Yes, you’re getting fat and your hair is turning grey
 But you still can flirt, believe me
 Ah, sometimes you act like a child, so silly
 Gruff and wanton by turn Do you remember? Do you remember? Don’t say no now
 Do you remember, that you said then?
 The happiest couple, that’s the both of us
 My love, dearest darling, never ends Be nice once again, just like then
 Ask me once again for a kiss
 Bring me roses again, blush again
 When you see me, just like then Be nice and gallant once again
 Find me beautiful and charming again
 Then the world will be just like before
 A fairyland"
"Telefon, Telefon","Telephone, telephone
Whenever I hear your call
I ask myself at the first ring
What news it will give me Telephone, telephone
Time is passing by quietly
I've been waiting for a long, long time already
The same way today as yesterday You know my greatest desire
For the most beautiful thing in the world
Which will keep my heart and soul
In suspense, all day and night Telephone, telephone
I've been alone for a long time
Tell, when will I be
Rewarded with happiness? ""Hello? How do you do?""
""Hello! Thank you!""
That's what I can hear from all countries in the worl
""Hello? Thank you, yes, yes""
""Hello! You're welcome!""

Telephone, telephone You know my greatest desire
For the most beautiful thing in the world

Tell, when will I be
Rewarded with happiness?"
La belle amour,"If you love nature
Lilacs, little birds
Muscadet, fried foods
And beautiful adventures
Follow the water's edge

You will see a tavern
Where you can get drunk
With the tunes of a musette ball
Lisette's clear eyes
Before deciding
To dare everything in a kiss

As water flows at the source
This song
It's the song that girls and boys
Each sing in their own way
It will be, that's for sure
In every heart
And forever
The song of beautiful love

Let's sing it again under the lilacs
And lon-lon-la here and there
It's beautiful love

Meanwhile autumn has arrived
The tavern with closed windows
Has no one in love anymore, nobody comes
When it's time
To dream on the water's edge

It's the ball of the dead leafs
That danse on the gravel
And that go from door to door
With the wind that carries them
Swirled by thousands
Waiting for what, springtime?

Let's sing it again under the lilacs
And lon-lon-la here and there
It's beautiful love
Beautiful love"
Skibet skal sejle i nat,"Goodbye then, my lass, stay well
I confess, my heart gives kind of a twinge
While I'm kissing you now
I love you
But the ship is leaving tonight
But the ship is leaving tonight We met in fun, we courted a little
But what was carelessness, suddenly became serious
And you became everything to me
Now there's only you
But the ship is leaving tonight
Yes, the ship is leaving tonight We're making a plan, we're dreaming a dream
We're fighting forward, despite head wind and current
Towards what we want so badly
Then suddenly we see
That the ship is leaving tonight
Yes, the ship is leaving tonight Evening in the sign of the new moon
Two standing in the dark on the quay
Girl and man
One from the sea, one from land
Everything is said, now they're just standing there
In silence
Finally she says: Goodbye then, my friend, take care of yourself
I think, you've been so nice and fair
And I'll be faithful to you
My life became the two of us
But the ship is leaving tonight
But the ship is leaving tonight Although I'm yours, with mind and body
And now I can make a fuss and resist
Against what I know will happen
And cry and beg
For the ship is leaving tonight
Yes, the ship is leaving tonight Suddenly the world stops
You hear the signal bell sounding
Your hopes lie broken, every single one
We humans mean so little The happiness, we think is firm and solid
It's only on an indefinite shore leave
For everything, we own, must go
We think, it is ours
But the ship is leaving tonight
Yes, the ship is leaving tonight"
L'enfant que j'étais,"The child that I was, where does she play today?
The flowers that I used to love, who picked them for me?
My heart, do you remember the white dresses?
On the lost way of our Sundays
Words to sing a friend's face
Nights to dream I was rich
When the heart on the watch, the straggling lock
Goes to school, the child that I was. Winter time, wrinkle takes you
Love time, and we're growing
Much water had flowed under the bridge
Forgotten dreams with the passing seasons A smile time and we are in love
Time to lie and yet we are old The child that I was, where is he straying?
The flowers I used to love, who had made them fake?
My heart, do you remember our promises?
Life didn't want your tenderness Words to love, hopes and nights.
Golden lies, I was so rich
When the heart on the watch, love in head
Going to the fair, the child that I was."
Nel blu dipinto di blu (Volare),"I think that a dream like this
won't come back anymore.
I was painting my hands
and my face blue.
Then suddenly I was being
enraptured by the wind.
And I was beginning to fly
in the endless sky. To fly, oh, oh!
To sing, oh, oh, oh, oh!
In the blueness, painted in blue.
Happy, to be up there.
And I was flying, was flying
happily, higher than the sun
and still higher.
While the world slowly, slowly
was disappearing far away down there
a sweet music was playing
just for me. To fly, oh, oh!
To sing, oh, oh, oh, oh!
In the blueness, painted in blue.
Happy, to be up there. But all the dreams,
at dawn, disappear because,
when the moon sets,
it takes them away.
But I continue to dream
in your beautiful eyes
that are blue like a
star-studded sky. To fly, oh, oh!
To sing, oh, oh, oh, oh!
In the blueness of your blue eyes.
Happy, to be down here.
And I continue to fly happily,
higher than the sun
and still higher.
While the world
slowly, slowly disappears
in your blue eyes
your voice is a sweet music
playing for me. To fly, oh, oh!
To sing, oh, oh, oh, oh!
In the blueness of your blue eyes.
Happy, to be down here.
In the blueness of your blue eyes.
Happy, to be down here,
with you."
Heel de wereld,"I must tell my secret to the whole world
Because I’m happy
The whole world is now twice as important to me
Because now I know what happiness is
But isn’t this world too busy?
Who still has time for happiness?
Yet I want to cheer because
I must tell my secret to the whole world
Because I’m happy Shall I write cards to let everyone know?
Shall I advertise in the paper?
It doesn’t matter for me how I tell it
But it must be known throughout the country But isn’t this world too busy?
Who still has time for happiness?
Yet I want to cheer because
I must tell my secret to the whole world
Because I’m happy"
"Dors, mon amour","Sleep, my love
 The sun is still far from the day
 We have all the time to love
 And the night understands us Sleep, my love
 Protected by my arms that surround
 Your sleep with a curtain of happiness
 Sleep onto my heart I’m a king
 That holds his whole kingdom in his fingers
 And that shivers of seeing fall down
 This enchanted kingdom Sleep, my love
 My princess, locked up in her tower
 With all the refrains of the night
 My sleepy princess I’m following your soul step by step on its way of joy
 And I amuse myself by leaning over your starry sleep Sleep, my love
 The sun is still far from the day
 We have all the time to love
 And the night understands us Sleep, my love
 Protected by my arms that surround
 Your sleep with a curtain of happiness
 Sleep onto my heart I hear the voice
 Of your life that beats so close to me
 And I feel like a very gentle blow
 That caresses my cheek Sleep, my love
 My princess, locked up in her tower
 I see the morning smile
 Here’s the sun of tomorrow
 The great sun of the eternal love"
Un grand amour,"A big love, it begins
Without being thought of most of the time
And we listen to a romance
Born from an emotional silence

Because you know that when we love each other
Words are too much
What's the use of dreaming of a poem?
The most recent moment ist just as beautiful

Eyes that get lost quickly
And then they are hesitant to come back
To the eyes that are looking for them
And that are enticing them to smile at them

Here is how love rises
And how it makes you do crazy things
We don't live love in prose anymore
We turn it into poetry

A big love, oh dear, comes to an end
Like a beautiful dream in a sigh
Once again grief encloses you
The comofortable rest has just ended

It won't matter that life is short
And that its drive slows down one day
If friendship takes over
When a big love comes to an end

If friendship takes over
When a big love comes to an end"
Lilla stjärna,"La la la la la la la la la...

la la la la la la la la la... Night over countryside and town, sleeping houses
The windows glitter, because of the star light
A girl standing by the window, looking up to the blue
Just fifteen years old, but still she's thinking Little star up above, answer me, answer me
Is he coming, the man that I will love?
Yes, you'll probably know who he is
You probably know whom I am talking about
Will I read in his eye, the same answer, the same answer
That I think I see you twinkling to me now
You, little star? Is he coming? Is he coming?
Yes, you'll probably know who he is Will I read in his eye, the same answer, the same answer
That I think I see you twinkling to me now
You, little star?"
Jeg rev et blad ud af min dagbog,"When you left in anger, I regretted
The fault was mine - reason, well... it tricked me
What we had together, was beautiful and great
Do you know what I've done today? I tore a leaf out of my diary
Every little word I regret, my dear
What's the use, that I'm wise afterwards
If you think, everything must come to an end? Try to forgive me, even if it is hard
Then I'll promise you, that it will never happen again
I tore a leaf out of my diary
You do the same, my friend If you hate me, really, you have a reason
My jealousy, I was more than mean
Do try to forgive, that I was bad
And if you're great enough, well then forget I tore a leaf out of my diary
Every little word I regret, my dear
What's the use, that I'm wise afterwards
If you think, everything must come to an end? Try to forgive me, even if it is hard

Ma petite chatte,"I had a bad day
That may happen to you tomorrow
I was randomly walking the streets
Aimlessly and without thinking of anything

When I saw down there
Who was approaching me
You didn't believe me
But now you can see it's true

She held all the trump cards in her game
And she had elegance to the tip of her fingers
Arguments, as much as you want, here they are
That made me all giddy with excitement

She had kind of a funny look
That made her look like she wasn't one of those
She smiled at me
Sure of the effect she had

I didn't believe that there could be
Toys like that on earth
It was a dream to see that little sweetheart
Not any higher than that

With wicked eyes
Like those that are told about in songs
And everything that is needed
To be liked by the boys

And it was a romantic novel
A story with a happy ending
Because it happened the way it always does
I married her one beautiful morning

And when the evening had come
I wanted to imagine
That it is unbelievable
But I'll let you know

She had many arguments and trumps in her game
That I never returned from there
In the blink of an eye
She made me all giddy with excitement

She had kind of a funny look
That made her look like she wasn't one of those
She smiled at me
Sure of the effect she had

I didn't beleive that there could be
Toys like that on earth
It was a dream to have that little sweetheart
Cuddled up to me

With wicked eyes
Like those that are told about in songs
And everything that is needed
To be liked by the boys

But yes
And everything that can make you
Lose your mind
Mmm...
And everything that can't be
Told in songs"

No!

Could it be different to me?
No!

The mouth needs tenderness
The hand, it wants to be stroked

Mon ami Pierrot,"My poor Pierrot
You are bowing low
And your face looks sad
As your life as an artist They don't like you anymore
Your love songs
Are too tame
Leave your velvet clothes there The public give a bravo
Decided your destiny
The curtain of your life
Must be dropped The comedy is over
Your theatre is dead
And your song has escaped
Into the night My poor Pierrot
My friend Pierrot
Who has so much bad luck
In the clear moonlight My friend Pierrot
Who has only two words
I really loved your style of writing
Even if it was nothing but a sobbing Even if times have changed
Old-fashioned harlequin
I will always be
Your friend Because you have enchanted
My most beautiful years
That's why I tell you
Today ""My friend Pierrot
Who is bowing low
Who has no stage anymore
Come on and sing about your loves and worries
With me"""
Een beetje,"I wanted your heart to be a closet with a little door
And that I could look in the little interior
Then you had to be sincere, good or bad, but true
And then you'd soon say, when I asked: ""Are you faithful?"" A bit, everyone is in love at least once, you know that
You want to be sensible, but you forget that
As soon as you listen to what Amor whispers
Then you know, it will be something like Faust and Gretchen
With little rendezvous in a little café
And strolling in the moonshine With the smell of roses
And kissing goodbye at the door
The night is blue, you whisper mouth to mouth
I swear eternal allegiance to you A bit, you were in love more than once, mister, you know that
Your heart came up with a little idea more than once
You were sorry, but ah you know, sometimes you forget
Maybe a bit too soon, your little oath of loyalty But actually, I'm happy that my heart has no door either
Because you never know what may live there in the interior
I'm willing to promise, when we get engaged
And you ask: ""Are you faithful?"", I'll never say to you... With the smell of roses
And kissing goodbye at the door
The night is blue, you whisper mouth to mouth
I swear eternal allegiance to you A bit, you were in love more than once, mister, you know that
Your heart came up with a little idea more than once
You were sorry, but ah you know, sometimes you forget
Maybe a bit too soon, your little oath of loyalty"

Augustin,"Dear child, can't you stay at home this evening
Darkness has almost already fallen
Please mother, you know we're going to meet tonight
You don't want him to go by himself, do you?
If he has to wait a second for his friend
He goes straight home and never comes back Augustin never waits for a girl who's in love
He is young, he is the king, he's handsome and popular
Hold my hat, where are the shoes?
Get the brooch in my jewellery box
Soon I'll be meeting Augustin Dear mother, please don't stay up and wait for me
Soon I'll be turning twenty-two
I won't be as late as I was the night before
Oh, now I must hurry
If I run quickly, I'll make it on time
Oh, there's a run in my stocking, and it had to be just now Augustin never waits for a girl who's in love
He is young, he is the king, he's handsome and popular
Will he now go away and whistle at Kristin instead?
Or are you waiting for me, Augustin? With surprise and worry he waits in the moonlight
What kind of nonchalance is this?
He's never had the intention to wait for a girl that's late
No, he'd rather give somebody else a chance
But that's how life is: What you don't get
Is exactly what you want, if you understand my drift Augustin had to wait, until he was as much in love himself
Even though he was young, even though he was a king
Even though he was handsome and popular
Yes, that's what happens to someone who grows masculine too quickly
And Augustin will never forget
And Augustin will never forget"

Don't let me be alone

Why am I so alone? From somwhere, this melody of love will come across the sea
Even if you haven't thought about anymore for a long time
I will never forget this time My fairytale of happiness, please, do come back to me

"Looking High, High, High","I once had a love, and oh
I loved her very dearly
She told me she loved me so
I thought she spoke sincerely
But one day, away
I found that she had flown
And off to find that love of mine
I set alone

Looking high, high, high
Looking low, low, low
Wondering: ""Why, why, why
Did she go, go, go?""
For if I, I, I
Don't find my love, I know
I shall die, die, die
'Cause I love her so

I journeyed across the sea
I sought her with devotion
""Oh, where she could really be?
I've not the slightest notion""
But so bright the light
Of love within me shone
I knew full well, what ever befell
I must go on

Looking high, high, high
Looking low, low, low
Wondering: ""Why, why, why
Did she go, go, go?""
For if I, I, I
Don't find my love, I know
I shall die, die, die
'Cause I love her so

Due east over desert sands
Due west where grass is greener
I asked in a dozen lands
But none had ever seen her
It was clear, I fear
My quest was all in vain
So I departed, sad at heart
For home again

Looking high, high, high
Looking low, low, low
Wondering: ""Why, why, why
Did she go, go, go?""
For if I, I, I
Don't find my love, I know
I shall die, die, die
'Cause I love her so

But when I arrived, all brown
And tanned by wind and weather
You sure could have knocked me down
With the proverbial feather
She stood there, so fair
And sweetly she confessed
That she'd been wrong, and all along
She'd loved me best

I'd looked high, high, high
I'd looked low, low, low
Wondering: ""Why, why, why
Did she go, go, go?""
Now that I, I, I
Have found my love, I know
Till I die, die, die
I will love her so

Don't find my love, I know
I shall die, die, die

Alla andra får varann,"Only, only you and I
Have to drift apart every day
Whereas all the others get together Why does it have to be that way?
Why do we have to be the unlucky ones
Now that all the others get together? If only I dared to make a proposal
I guess you'd give me your ""I do""
But happiness has to wait
Until I have taken courage one day I have to attend weddings
But I only get to sit around and watch
All the others getting together They might sort it out
And then it would run smoothly
If it were possible to make a proposal like in the old days:
By exchange of letters Yeah... darling, maybe one fine day
You and I
Will get together just like all the others"
So laang we's du do bast,"As long as you are there
As long as you are there, as long as you are near me
As long as my eyes only see you
As long as you are here, being lovely and faithful
So long it can't be anything more beautiful to me
Look at all my thoughts, they're swaying, they're staggering
They will be with you always and I can't help it
As long as you are there, as long as you are near me
So long it can't be anything more beautiful to me
Even if you will go away then, going to the north forever
You won't notice my secret tears
And if you asked me, then I would have to admit
As long as you were there, so long everything was fine
That's the way life is: some things will go wrong
Times of happiness pass by much too fast
When you will go to the north then, believe me, even when you will go away
As long as you are there, so long everything was fine"
Det var en yndig tid,"Think about the romance and grace
That used to be in the world

And a parasol

She would virtuously go to her mother
And say: ""May I ask you something?""

When the clock stroke twelve
And there was nobody

Of fighting and arguing

Back then there were no cars
And simply no Bellevue
And the maiden's smiles were shy

Mon amour pour toi,"My love for you, it's like the sea
When no one has walked on the sand
My love for you, it's like the winter
When the star has found its stable I share the cobblestones on the path with you
The clear dawn, the iced water and the bread
My love for you, it's like the sea
The blue sky in winter
The tender dawn and the clear water A bit of wind that goes round in circles
Around an old church bell
Four boats on the grey sea
A little dance, painted neon And under my minuscule room
The broken echo of a men's chorus
That makes a song dance
On my nighttime drunkenness My love for you, it's like the sea
When no one has walked on the sand
My love for you, it's like the winter
When the star has found its stable I share the cobblestones on the path with you
The clear dawn, the iced water and the bread
My love for you, it's like the sea
The blue sky in winter
The tender dawn and the clear water My love, my love for you"
Voi voi,"In a small valley far up in the North
Where the sun shines all night long

The Sothern wind brought it over the sea
The girl was so cheerful and carefree
And she was born with rhythm In a small valley as happy as only few are
I once heard a song that sounded like this: Hey hey
High up in the mountains
Can you hear my hello1?
Hey hey
This way2 I want to tell you
That I'm waiting for you Hey hey

While I'm waiting for my darling

Is it really such a long time ago?
You even don't remember it?
Oh... that is unpossible
Because it was so indescribable
I told you every day:
You fascinated me so much
That nothing interested me but to dream about you at night
You fascinated me so much
That I like nothing in the world but you, honey
You fascinated me so much
Yes, you hypnotized me
So that I don't know what I'm doing
And what happens then
Because you fascinated me so much
Unfortunately I have to include one thing:
Everybody knows it, but you"
Ce soir-là,"That night you only had your youth
To offer me like a bouquet of spring
In the love that often disappointed me
I didn't believe anymore, but when I saw you... That night I wanted to invent
Words that had never existed
Words of love in full dress
For that night In your arms, I understood that from that night
Life would never have attraction for me
Far from you My love, I have given you the best
The best of the deepest of my heart
Of my heart that is still saving the tenderness
Of that night That night, but what good is returning?
All that is for me only a memory
But I've never been able to free myself from a crazy dream
That I cherished I had given you much more than my life
But maybe you didn't understand
That you tore my childhood dream
By leaving me And if you still come back to me one day
In my heart, I save like the first day
So much love So much love always for you who I'm waiting for
Who I'm waiting for like someone waiting for spring
Spring, my arms full of lilacs
For that night My love, I'll wait for you every day
As long as I live, I'll be there
That night..."
Cielo e terra,"Heaven and earth, dream and life
On the street of who loves you, like me
The confine of a date
You weren't there and instead now, you're with me
With thoughts and words you color
A name closed deep within your heart
Now it's true, I have my sun
But I wonder: will tomorrow still be mine? An hour of sweet intimacy is so short
Then why think about it? About what will then be? Heaven and earth, dream and life
On the street of who loves you, like me
The confine of a date
I didn't know, and now I know everything about you An hour of sweet intimacy is so short
Then why think about it? About what will then be? Heaven and earth, dream and life
On the street of who loves you, like me
The confine of a date
I didn't know, and now I know everything about you Heaven and earth, dream and life"
Wat een geluk,"What luck that I’m a little piece of the world

And that I can join in with all that lives
And can breathe with all that has a breath
I’m so happy that there are always daffodils in May
And that there are fruits, butterflies, foals, birds and fish
And all that happiness is only thanks to you
Because I love you terribly, incurably When you ask me then, “Is that trite?”
I say yes, but I moan on yet for a while
Ah, what am I to do, because I love you
And that is simply something beyond description I only have the familiar “darling, I love you”
The “sweatheart, I adore you” and the old “be faithful to me”
Myself, I think it’s very primitive too
But then again, why are you so sweet? What luck that I’m a little piece of the world

Romantic. You are romantic.
To love you is to live again
In simplicity,
In unreality of another age. You are romantic,
A friend of clouds
Which search from above
A bit of sun as you do. You are the music
Which inspires the soul.
You are my corner of paradise, here on the Earth. And I am next to you,
I have come back to live.
I will tell you,
I will trust you my dreams

It's the day of spring
Let's go children, open wide your ears
Listen to the song of the awaking streams
And you others – the clouds, be obedient and go on
It's the day of spring
Live, we are about to live
Freely like the wind
Rich, we are rich
Of a thousand promises, of youth and of good weather
Let's go children, prisoners of the towns
The sky, good child, offers you its fields of stars
It's sufficient to choose one, there's a fortune hidden in it
It's the day of spring
Let's go children, today life is beautiful
With a feeling of pride, I tell you the news
For me it's the day of glory, of victory
This day of spring, it's love that is awaiting me
Let's go my love, I only dream of foam
The first beautiful days, it seems so soft
That's why I proposed you something
Go in the fields, see if the wolf is there
Live, I want to live
Freely under the blue sky
Rich, I feel rich
Of love and of fresh water that I fished in your eyes
Let's go children, today life is beautiful
On the field they just have to spread the news
A beautiful white page, all white, is opened now
It's the day of spring
Love, love, love is waiting for us"
Sehnsucht,"Longing
When you come back to me again
When you come back to me again, my luck
Then all fairy tales become true
And I will always be yours
The bells will ring for you
They just sing for me and for you
The song of our love
And the world will be full of longing
So think of it
Even I'm far away from you
Think of it, I will always be with you
Think of it, I will always be with you
The bells will ring for you
They just sing for me and for you
The song of our love

Valoa ikkunassa,"Under a cloak the night has left the land
The time to put out the lights has come
Only shadows //vakavina//* in their place
Now they go to dream A light remains in a small window
Who stays awake accompanied by thoughts?
She longs for her love*
So she sings with hope The rays of light lead me to memories
The eternal lamp is an unfading memory Through a silent night behind a constellation
The song plays to him if he can hear A new beautiful star ignites
The singer too notices its brightness
The beloved places the light in the window
He hears me in his longing The light remains under the break of dawn
The singer falls into a deep sleep
She goes with thanks to her love
on the wings of dreams"

When everything which at first seemed a dream
Exists in reality What a day, what a day
Really a day when everything succeeds
I have even picked some flowers unpunished
In the park across the street I’m walking in the street, singing
Hey, old neighbour, don’t look so sour
I do no harm
I’m only madly happy
Just don’t bother about me What a day, what a day
People, can I please
Waste this day and do crazy stuff?

Einmal sehen wir uns wieder,"We'll see each other once again
Everywhere in the world the departure is difficult
And sometimes the heart hurts
All words that you say
You don't believe them yourself anymore
Have a nice life, goodbye
Another smile – a kiss
Another wave – a greeting
And a ship goes out
And with it goes luck
Yet hope remains
We'll see each other once again
And maybe already next year
We'll see each other once again
Then everything will be as it used to be
That's why I believe in our love
No matter what may happen
Somewhere, some day, always remember
We'll see each other again
And the Sunday was grey, and the sky was heavy
And the rain hammered on the roof
And as you walked along the street down to the sea
I was watching you from my window
So much love – gone
So many dreams – gone
I don't know where you are
But your last words still ring in my heart
Far, further than the end of the world
My love is close to you
And my straying heart
Will never beat for anyone but you
That's why I believe in our love
No matter what may happen
Always remember: somewhere, some day
We'll see each other again
Always remember: somewhere, some day
We'll see each other again"
Printemps (Avril carillonne),"Springtime, April rings
Ding and dong and ding and dong, listen in the light air to
Just four notes going for a walk
Ding and dong and ding and dong running by mounts and valleys
They delight the amazed nature with songs
Springtime, springtime, April rings
The marmot wakes up at the first sun
Springtime, springtime, the bees buzz
While all the leafbuds open their homes
The hedgehog sharpens its not-so-nasty quills
The finch plays the flute, flying happily
Springtime, springtime, the wind swirls
Sowing butterflies on every bush
Ding and dong and ding and dong in the shadow of the forest
The spider pulls the bells of the lily-of-the-valley with the end of his thread
Ding and dong and ding and dong, all dancing like a fool
The winding stream plays with the pebbles
Springtime, springtime, April rings
Mr Badger who slept, goes out to take some fresh air
Springtime, springtime, the touchy look
The snail comes to get drunk of a dewdrop
And the ant worries, she has run out of provisions
But the cicada is getting ready for making a song
Springtime, springtime, on the freezing water
A big leaf of water lily pampers tadpoles
Springtime, springtime, April rings
The squirrel plays hide-and-seek behind his bushy tail
Springtime, springtime, the toad is on the go
Looking at himself in a water pool, he thinks he's very beautiful
And the turtle travels, all wedding guests are waiting for her
At the beautiful marriage of two turtledoves
Springtime, springtime, April rings
And when I hear it, I have a satisfied heart
I have a satisfied heart
I have a satisfied heart"
Nous aurons demain,"Tomorrow we'll have
Gardens to gather the bouquets of our dreams
Tomorrow we'll have
A morning to smile at the rising sun
Tomorrow we can
Prepare in silence, in the same house
The cradle of luck that we'll have tomorrow You complain about living in a lightless box
You have no Sundays, and I have no roof
When I leave my lightless suburb in the morning
You return to your home in another neighborhood Tomorrow we'll have
Less time to kill, fewer solitary nights
Tomorrow we'll go
Into the woods to go to sleep or to jump over the rivers Tomorrow we'll have
Friends who will come without knocking under the moon
And even the fortune that we'll have tomorrow You tell me that time distances us every day
You tell me that tomorrow is a long way away
We never live in the castles in Spain
But my dear, is it necessary to refuse to build them? Tomorrow we'll have
Less time to kill, fewer solitary nights
Tomorrow we'll go
Into the woods to go to sleep or to jump over the rivers Tomorrow we'll have
Friends who will come without knocking under the moon
And even the fortune that we'll have tomorrow That we'll have tomorrow
That we'll have tomorrow"
"September, gouden roos","A golden rose, September
a last kiss of the sun
A blackbird whistles full of nostalgia
The refrain of a season
Still the summer will sing
A deeply moving song
That will softly fade away
Only sadness will remain for us The days are slowing down and sliding over
The summer is getting tired, oh, so tired Now we have to part
Our heart is getting quiet and fragile
When we see it blooming again
September, golden rose As soon as the first leaves are falling in the woods
A red ivy shackles to a window
When evening mists hang in the valleys
Then I know that summer is over But before it leaves, it will linger for a moment
As if it wants to pay the farewell with… A golden rose, September
A last kiss of the sun
A blackbird whistles full of nostalgia
The refrain of a season Still the summer will sing
A deeply moving song
That will softly fade away
Only sadness will remain for us The days are slowing down and sliding over
The summer is getting tired, oh, so tired Now we have to part
Our heart is getting quiet and fragile
When we see blooming again
September, golden rose September, golden rose"

And if I wore Caruso's cape

And I'd paint you lovely and bashful
If I could paint as Rembrandt could
And I'd worship you on a violin
If I could play like Menuhin

I don't master singing and string playing
Just let me dream a little of you, Angelique
So I feel as just a single little pawn
In the mosaic of you life
Around the world there are wonderful girls
Some have the soft, and some have the fiery look
But if I searched in all of the most wonderful countries

That watches us or else the iron and the fire
It’s true, the idiots and the evil ones
Harm us, do bad things to us

They are a thousand and we are two, the lovers But the hour is going to ring on the least difficult nights
And I could love you without them talking about it downtown
It’s promised, it’s written down We, the lovers – the sun shines for us
And we sleep on the knees of the Good Lord
We, the lovers – He gave us the right
To be happy and to be joyful together Then, the without-loves, the mis-loved
It will be necessary that we pay back
Those who have never been condemned
We, the lovers, we’re going to live without you
For the sky is with us, the lovers"

 And all the little girls should be locked up then
 When winter turns to sun and spring Once in the shop he couldn’t find anything
 And soon we were outside again
 I said ‘goodbye’ and had begun walking
 When he yelled: “Wait, listen” As a proof of his gratitude
 He wanted to buy me lunch somewhere
 It was the first sunny day of spring
 So I was stupid enough to say yes When it’s sun and spring and you’re nineteen years old
 You understand so little
 And all the little girls should be locked up then
 When winter turns to sun and spring He conversed with elegance
 And bought me the best meal the place had to offer
 But then he went to call a friend
 And didn’t come back And the man working in the cloakroom said:
“Yes, your husband took your fur coat
 And went to the tailor”
So I had to call my own Knut
 Who came and bailed me out When it’s sun and spring and you’re nineteen years old
 You understand so little
 And all the little girls should be locked up then
 When winter turns to sun and spring"
Zwei kleine Italiener,"For others a journey to the South is something chic and find
But two little Italians would rather be back home. Two little Italians, dreaming of Naples.
Of Tina and Marina, who've been waiting for a long time
Two little Italians, who are so alone.
For others a journey to the South is something chic and find
But two little Italians would rather be back home. Oh Tina, Oh Marina, if we get to see each other again,
But both Italians would rather be back home. Two little Italians never forget their home.
The palm trees and the girls on the beach of Naples
Two little Italians, they understand.
For others a journey to the South is something chic and find
But two little Italians would rather be back home. Oh Tina, Oh Marina, if we get to see each other again,
But both Italians would rather be back home. Two Little Italians at the station, everybody knows them there.
They come every morning for the express train to Naples.
Two Little Italians, looking at the train as it leaves.

Katinka,"Every morning, at half past eight
We meet Katinka
Red bonnet and blond locks
Bright yellow shirt, blue skirt
But she trips silently beside her mum
That’s why all the boys who long for her, sing Little coquettish Katinka
Now, look round for once
Sneaky over your shoulder
Your mum doesn’t see it, so come on Little coquettish Katinka
Are you maybe shy?
We really want to see for a moment
A glimpse of your tip-tilted nose Every morning, sun or rain
We meet Katinka
Heels tick-tack on the pavement
Short skirt with narrow cut But her look doesn’t betray no or yes
That’s why all the boys who long for her, sing Little coquettish Katinka
Now, look round for once
Sneaky over your shoulder
Your mum doesn’t see it, so come on Little coquettish Katinka
Are you maybe shy?
We really want to see for a moment
A glimpse of your tip-tilted nose Little coquettish Katinka

Un premier amour,"A first love, first love, first love
Is never forgotten, never forgotten, never forgotten
A first love, we always look for it
In other loves, we pursue it our whole life It confused us and made us dream and made us tremble
This first love, first love, first love
But the child that we are, the child that we remained
Will always hum in memory of this love And you, you that I loved
What did you make of yourself?
What did you do without me?
And me, me who lost you
What have I done more?
Was I so much more lucky?
Did we actually know..... A first love, first love, first love
Is never forgotten, never forgotten, never forgotten
A first love, we always look for it
In other loves, we pursue it our whole life That all these kisses that we have stolen rather than given
These innocent gestures engaged us for so long
No, the children we still were back then
Didn't suspect much, they were delighted
That a first love, their first love was so strong"
"Kom sol, kom regn","May there be sun, may there be rain
Come whatever may
As long as you are here
May there be sun, may there be rain
As long as we exist
Happiness is always
Around you, around me Rain turns into sunshine
Whenever you just smile at me
The two of us follow the way of summer May there be sun, may there be rain
So what might go wrong1 now that I
Have everything that I
Could ever wish for in you? Many times I hoped
For a day to come, my day
But the doubt sowed worries in my mind
My world was so fretful
And I went along with its unrest
But then you came
And the world became mine May there be sun, may there be rain
The only thing I know
Is that happiness will stay with us
If we hold onto our love"
Le retour,"After the time of the beating hearts
Of truant paths, of light steps
After the long stay of the far-off beautiful days
Everyone has their turn, it's the return
We grew old in the beautiful time
Of our four hundred blows, a little too much
And see that at the detour of a too-short path
Everyone has their turn, it's the return Someone told him: ""You should know that youth passes""
He understood when his mirror grimaced at him
He threw away the flower of age
At the same time as his baggage In searching too much, we've wasted
The best of what we had in the depths of our eyes
And see that at the detour of a too-short path
Everyone has their turn, it's the return But the other time that waits for us
Will be worth other joys to you, to me
It's time without detours, the time of love
Everyone has their turn, it's the return Yes, the return of new days"
Ne pali svetlo u sumrak (Не пали светло у сумрак),"In the warm darkness of the room,
two cigarettes
Two tiny lights are closer and closer This night is made for them,
this dream is so slow and quiet
Two stars will now depart on a long journey In the blue glass of the vase,
under the roses
Two tiny lights are closer and closer That day was so quiet,
now sleep is descending upon them
You’re putting out your cigarette, embracing sleep That day was so quiet,
now sleep is descending upon them
Two stars will depart on a long journey This night is made for them,
now sleep is coming, so quiet
You’re putting out your cigarette,
embracing sleep Don’t turn the lights on at twilight"
Ring-a-Ding Girl,"(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)
(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)

I was strollin' through the park one evenin'
When a strange feelin' came over me
A vision of loveliness came in view
It was love, it was plain to see

Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
All the bells were ringin'
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
All the world was singin'
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding

She's my ring-a-ding girl
(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)
(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)

Very shortly, we were dating steady
I asked her if her love was true
She gave me the answer with her lips
Every time that we kissed, I knew

Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
All the bells were ringin'
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
All the world was singin'
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding

She's my ring-a-ding girl
(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)
(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)

I have waited patiently, my darlin'
When can we fix the date and the time?
She answer so softly and tenderly:
""I can't wait till the day you're mine""

I had that strange feelin' once again
Just the same as the day we met

All the bells were ringin'
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding
All the world was singin'

Petit bonhomme,"Little boy
Little boy, at the end of your childhood
Little boy, you'll have to quit
You'll leave like someone goes on holiday
On the paths of liberty
Little boy, that's how life leads us
And the children escape from their parents
I had joy, soon I will have pain
And I'll understand you, I love you and I wait for you
I hear you sleeping and your childhood dreams
Are memories for me for when you'll be grown-up
Bigger than me, tomorrow already
Little boy, I hqve to tell you
Little boy, and you won't believe it
But sometimes I packed my suitcases
And quickly unpacked them because of you
Little boy, at the day of the great path
I will be alone and you won't come
But I'll say: ""My son is on a journey""
""He went a lot further, a lot further than me"""
"Addio, addio","Our smiles have been shut down
We walk together, and we are alone
We've got only long silences that are pushing us to say:
Goodbye, goodbye
Our love, seawater, has become salt
Our parched lips don't have any more words
Look at me, look at me, you know that it's not right
It's not right that our love has finished Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye Look at me, look at me, listen to me, and stop
It's not right, because you are crying Because we know it (Because we know it)
That we love each other (That we love each other)
That we love each other and we let each other go Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye"
Dis rien,"Say nothing
Say nothing, say nothing, we love each other
That's the true poem
And I'm feeling so well
My body drowning in yours
I'm as in a wave
Where my happiness roams
It's so profound, profound
I feel myself streaming in the depths
Say nothing, words are silly
For someone who isn't a poet
They're bubbles that blow
The words, it kills the dreams
My hands play on your dress
Nothing of you is revealed
In my two closed arms
Let me, let me love you
Say nothing, say nothing, my soul
Your eyes possess it like a flame
The words are all the same
Say nothing, say nothing, I love you
I don't know anymore where we are
You are a woman and I - a man
And if one dies of that
I want to die a hundred times
A hundred times, a hundred times
A hundred times"
Say Wonderful Things,"Say wonderful things to me
I think you're wonderful too
Say wonderful things to me
Especially 'I love you' (I love you)

They say I was living before we met
All of my yesterdays I forget
Now you are the one that I'm living for
And each day I love you more

So you must say wonderful things to me
I think you're wonderful too
Say wonderful things to me
Especially 'I love you' (I love you)

The more that I see you, the more it seems
People should always believe in dreams
Now all of my dreams I'm dreaming of you
And someday they'll all come true

So you must say wonderful things to me
I think you're wonderful too
Say wonderful things to me
Especially 'I love you' (I love you)

I'll never hurt you or make you cry
Love will grow stronger as years go by
Forever you'll be the one girl for me
I'll love you until I die

So you must say wonderful things to me
I think you're wonderful too
Say wonderful things to me
Especially 'I love you'

Een speeldoos,"A musical box
A musical box
From times long gone
There was a very little shepherdess
Made of fragile white china
And when the musical box tinkled
Then she danced elegantly to the refrain There was a shepherd facing her
But he was unapproachable
Because even when she asked the musical box for a dance
He didn’t come closer He couldn’t be happy either
So far away from her
But a fairy came softly on a spring night
And touched them very carefully The shepherd and his sherpherdess
Are now a couple for ever
And when you don’t want to believe this story
Just ask that fairy yourself one day
Because this fairy tale is true He couldn’t be happy either
So far away from her
But a fairy came softly on a spring night
And touched them very carefully The shepherd and his sherpherdess
Are now a couple for ever
And when you don’t want to believe this story
Just ask that fairy yourself one day Because those two are really together now
Really, this fairy tale is true"

Solhverv,"In the arms of the winter night
With nameless stars
When snow and ice and coldness
Cover everything on Earth A morning that is ready for dawn
And the night becomes day again
An hour of twilight
Is striking for my tired heart When the sun has changed its orbit1
And the day has turned on the lights
When you are with me, the night is over
We are humming along to a happy melody Now we are walking with springtime in our minds
Into the summer and the warmth of the sun
And the days come and the days go
During love's dawning springtime You who are mine, you are my dearly beloved
You are the symbol of light
Our winter is distant, our summer is close
And you are my truelove When the sun has changed its orbit
And the day has turned on the lights
Our winter is distant but our summer is close
In the lustre of the morning light"
Uno per tutte,"One for all
You're almost made for me, painted for me, Claudia
But I confess that I like you most, Nadia
I like everything of everyone, huhu lalala... always
I can never decide, and so I'm in trouble
I'm thinking of you and I see skies without clouds
And a thousand mandolins are caressing me
Then I open my eyes and that moment I realise that
There is no one, there is no one next to me
In love with you, wanting you, Laura
I'm not beautiful, but is it my fault, Julia?
On my mouth I have huhu lalala... kisses for you
And I'm dedicating them to the first one who will say yes

Dansevise,"A ray of sunshine in a puddle
A little kiss on the cheek from a wind
And the rush, humming
That life's beginning
It's a web in your mind A whistle of silver from a treetop
A faint sound of a cat grabbing
A ripple in the stream
A whisper in the hedge
That says, that it isn't night anymore The meadow is wet with dew
Lady Dawn goes to bed
Day gets up playfully
And crossing the bridge of the sun And the two of us?
What about the two of us?
Yes, what about the two of us, you and me?
I'm dancing and dancing and stopping
And sensing only you
Why ever did you run away? Come back, come back
Come back, you my beloved friend
Come back, come back
Wherever you wish, are we dancing to Come, let us dance
Everything can happen
Come, let us dance
Let us dance, let us laugh A whistle of silver from a treetop
A faint sound of a cat grabbing
A ripple in the stream
A whisper in the hedge
That says, that it isn't night anymore The meadow is wet with dew
Lady Dawn goes to bed

And crossing the bridge of the sun And the two of us?

Brodovi,"In my neighborhood, ships are like people
They cry, smile and love
In my neighborhood, ships are celebrities
And dearest toys of menacing boys Ships
Without you, all ports are sad
Without you, rivieras are desterted
Without you, seagulls die While the Moon cuts the night
On the stem of its verse
I ignite the fire of luck
For your journeys Ships
Loves await you
Windows await you
Without you, guitars die While dawn ignites day
On the mast of your verse
I raise this song
For your return While dawn ignites day
On the mast of your verse
I raise this song
For your return O, dear toys
From my childhood"
T'en va pas,"I couldn't find the words to keep you

Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
When I was talking a lot of nonsense
It wasn't my voice
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave In the darkest of summer, when the storm has fallen
The forests bloom again
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
If your heart and your body still remember
A last time
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave Love sometimes made fortresses fall down
Death sometimes made the living find themselves
My joy and my sadness, gone with the wind
Come back to me, you, I'm waiting for you You, my bread, my sun, that stole my sleep
With you, give it back to me
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
If your heart and your body still remember
A last time
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave And if my voice arrives there with you
Retrace your steps, your steps, your steps
Come back to me"

Her dress swirls, whirls and curls
And then, she's gone away... Oh, she was so beauti/ful

En gång i Stockholm,"""Come with me"", said my friend
The first silent winter snow is falling now
And the summer is over ""I've got a sailboat on Lake Klara""
""Come, my friend, my boat is as white as snow""
""Yes, come on, let's sail away"" ""Come, my friend, come onboard""
""There you can see our Riddarfjärd which the snow has covered all in white""
Now our boat is sailing out in the snow Yes, the winter in Stockholm is a strange world
Different kinds of seagulls in silent and beautiful snow
And the Island of Stockholm is lovely The sound of the German Church, it's silently shouting ""ding dong""
A magical shore, a magical land
That is hitting the two of us in our boat ""Hold my hand, hold my hand""
""To you and me, it's still summer""
""Come, sail out with me"" Wherever you and I are, there is summer
The summer, and it will never end
Because I, I love you Hold my hand, hold my hand"
Waarom?,"Why?
The language of love is often very miraculous
A word, a sign, an image, a small gesture
Only our heart understands that language

Are all the stars lighted every evening?
Why do the butterflies flutter cheerfully?
Does the bird's choir sing in May?
Why can we be full of nostalgia?
Why does our heart know joy and pain?
Listen to the blackbird, singing happily:
""I love you, do you love me too?""

L'amour s'en va,"Love is leaving
And yours probably won't last
Just like the others
Someday, you're going to leave me If it isn't you
It is me who will leave
Love is leaving
And we won't be able to do anything about it Because you, too,
Are going to tell me a thousand 'always'
And I, too,
Will say them back to you Love is leaving
I escape you when you go after me
Or maybe it's me
Who refuses to believe that everything is over And every time
Always, we must admit it to ourselves
Love is leaving
But ceaselessly, we run after it"
À force de prier,"By persistently praying, every night, every day
By persistently begging all the gods of love
By persistenly singing your name like a poem
By persistenly loving you, it will be necessary that you love me By persistently praying from the depth of my heart
And by despairing to find the happiness
When I will have cried until my sorrow is over
By persistently calling, it will be necessary that you come By persistently praying and by living of hope
The sun rose painfully on the fog
I'm going to be able to sing, shout, shout victory
My turn came, this day came
By persistently praying, love… love… love"
Dès que le printemps revient,"Once spring returns
The girls are pretty once spring is here
But the vows forget themselves once spring goes away
There in the prairie, I always await but in vain
A girl in organdy once spring returns
I think again about her eyes once spring is here
I see again our parting, once spring goes away
And her image hanging around the corner of my path
When the evenings become warm once spring returns
No, time can't do anything
No, it is not up to time
I believe I will find her once spring is here
I cease to dream about it once spring goes away
After many winters yet my heart remembers
As if it was yesterday once spring returns
No, time can't do anything
Oh no, it is not up to time
Sometimes I want to die once spring is here
I always believe to be healed once spring goes away
But I feel the sting of a pain that embraces me
Like an old wound once spring returns
Once spring returns, once spring returns
Once spring returns, once spring returns"

Nothing can tear us apart I know that you lie
And that you betray me
But I condone it

That you've almost believed them yourself

Sangen om dig,"The song about you is never over

Are sending me messages with alluring voices:
You are the only one that I love
Never forget Hope can burst apart and
People disappoint me bitterly, but
I've still got the song
That turns on a light again for my courage to face life The song about you, the melody of my life
Is humming about everything that you've given me
The song about you is never over
Because you mean my whole life to me Poets write so many
Times about the power of love
But even the most lovely song
Can't express everything Whatever is sorrow or joy
Lives deep down in your heart
No matter if I smile or cry
I'll hear a song without words The song about you, the melody of my life
Is humming about everything that you've given me
The song about you is never over
Because you mean my whole life to me"

However To sing without being ordered It’s Sunday again
And although it’ll soon be Monday
There’s no need to hurry
People who are lazing are singing Time to stand here and there
Questioning
Holding
The wall is in its place* Time to learn life’s rhythm
Life’s style
Life’s song
To the correct rhythm There’s a lot you can do
A satisfied song plays People who are lazing are singing
Hey, laari-laari-laa! Hey, laari-laari-laa!
People who are lazing are singing"
"Warum nur, warum?","Only why, why everything has to pass by?
Oh... only why, why nothing stays forever?
You leave me, you don't turn your head back
Give me the answer - only why, why? Only why, why the flowers bloom so beautiful
Oh... when will they fade and die?
A dream escapes, the time is up
Please, give me the answer - only why, why? Often I hear your words: I will be yours in eternity
I believed you, but it was just a pretence Oh yes... only why, why should everything be like this?
Oh... only why, why am I so alone?
Before you leave me, turn your head back
And then give me the answer - only why, why?
Why? Why?"
Le chant de Mallory,"Tell me again, Mallory
The song you sang to me
Your summer song
In the blue of the Irish sky
You were only 16 years old
I, I was still a child
And the night that came
Took us as lovers You, Mallory, you sang for me
The wind mixed up our hair
And I no longer really know why
We closed our eyes
Remember, Mallory
We had waited for the day
The both of us, dreaming,
I really believe that it was love Where is it, Mallory?
The song you sang to me
Your summer song
In the blue of the Irish sky
The sun was setting
Throwing gold into your eyes
We played at loving each other
But it was just a game to you Oh Mallory, where is that singing,
That summer love song,
Towards what country has the wind left
The wind that had brought it back,
Your song, Mallory
I will keep it forever
For it was the song,
The song of a first love La la la la la la...
For it was the song,
The song of a first love"
I Love the Little Things,"Oh... I love the little things you say
And I love the little things you do
Let's stay forever together this way
My love, I'm so in love with you

When you whisper 'I love you'
And tell me that you're true
I know I'm so lucky
That I've found a girl like you

Oh... I love the little things you say
And I love the little things you do
Let's stay forever together this way
My love, I'm so in love with you

When we're walking together
You slip your hand in mine
I know I'm so lucky
That I've found a girl so fine

I love the little things you say
And I love the little things you do
Let's stay forever together this way
My love, I'm so in love with you

When you touch me and hold me
And kiss me tenderly
I know I'm so lucky
That you came along for me

I love the little things you say
And I love the little things you do
Let's stay forever together this way
My love, I'm so in love with you
My love, I'm so in love with you"
Man gewöhnt sich so schnell an das Schöne,"A stranger came from somewhere
He gave me love and happiness
I gave away my heart, a love began
Now I only looked at him and I didn't look back One gets used to beautiful things so quickly
And then you can't let go of them anymore
One gets used to beautiful things so quickly
Once it's over, there will be a big disappointment Love, oh love, what a wonderful game
Never, you can never get enough of it One gets used to beautiful things so quickly
And then you can't let go of them anymore
One gets used to beautiful things so quickly
Once it's over, there will be a big disappointment Fidelity, fidelity, it's such a big word
Tears, tears – he ran away from me One gets used to beautiful things so quickly
And then you can't let go of them anymore
One gets used to beautiful things so quickly
Once it's over, there will be a big disappointment Love, oh love, what a wonderful game
Never, you can never get enough of it One gets used to beautiful things so quickly

Où sont-elles passées,"Where have they gone
Those who made me believe
The lovely story of the forbidden fruit? So much time is spent in the vain expectation
Of unsteady embraces
So much time is lost The heart, overflowing with so much tenderness
By my awkwardnesses kept its torment On the street, tenderly, they took my hand
A private conversation, seriously, they said tomorrow
When I think of it today, however
I smile of the time
Of the past time, to believe in this story Where have they gone
Those who made me believe
The lovely story of the forbidden fruit? But that past time which seemed mad
So much nostalgia it will be worth to me
Because the girls then had the mystery
Of the first loves which are lost forever Where have they gone
Those who made me believe
The lovely story of the forbidden fruit?"
Oração,"Lord, to your feet I confess
Lord, I mistreated my love
Lord, if I ask for pardon here, I don't deserve it
Lord, I despite my love and sinned
Pardon, thou I beg
Lord, you are the redemption
I know I lost it and I adore it and I cry
Lord, by pray your pardon Lord, I confess the perjure of so many promises
Lord, I mistook, but in life I found my lesson
Lord, I beg you, Lord
Oh my God, don't forget my pray
Lord, oh infinite goodness, give me your pardon Love, for love I never found in life
It's late, I walk through life lost in pain
Lord, this love is purest than the rarest jewelry
Than the purest love
Lord, if love is punishment, pardon, my Lord"
Non ho l'età,"I am young,
I am young to love you.
I am young to go out only with you. And it would be not necessary
It would be not necessary
To tell you anything
Because you know too much about me. Let me live
With a romantic love
In waiting
That that day will come
But not now. I am young,
I am young to love you.
I am young to go out only with you. If you wanted,
If you wanted
To wait for me.
You will have that day,
All my love for you. Let me live
With a romantic love
In waiting
That that day will come
But not now. If you wanted,
If you wanted
To wait for me.
You will have that day,
All my love for you."
Život je sklopio krug,"There is no escape anymore
The world has closed the circle
So may the plant and the bird
Be like a human, like a friend And if I became a branch
My leaves would ponder
Oh, and the red gold would not
Teem only in the autumn If I turned into stone
I would not be forgotten
I would be the only one on the shore
A thinking, blue stone There is no escape anymore
Life has come full circle
So may the hill and the dusk
Be like a human, like a friend If I turned into stone
I would not be forgotten
I would be the only one on the shore
A thinking, blue stone There is no escape anymore
Life has come full circle
So may the hill and the dusk
Be like a human, like a friend"
I miei pensieri,"I have always searched in time
To give you better thoughts
I've searched, looking in the sky
And up there I saw how to do it
For this...for this...
I entrust my thoughts to a cloud
So that it brings them to you, who is far away
The wind will lightly push it
High up in the sky, in the immensity Maybe words and stars can unite themselves
They will be golden letters written in the sky for you
The sun will certainly let them shine
Thus you'll see them up there with me I entrust my thoughts to a cloud
Softly, softly, it will come without making any noise
It will arrive all the way to you, my love I entrust my thoughts to a cloud
Softly, softly, it will come without making any noise
It will arrive all the way to you, my love Everybody will know what I think of you
Those golden cotton balls are for you"
Près de ma rivière,"Nearby my river
Nearby my river, with silver reflections
Between heaven and earth, we loved each other much
In the light grass we forgot our oath
Nearby my river, with silver fishes
There, the world was so far away
There, there was nothing left
Nothing but my eyes in your eyes
Nothing, nothing but the both of us
Nearby my river, with silver reflections
Between heaven and earth, we loved each other much
The river is flowing and the time is flowing away
Sad and solitary, I'm coming now
Nearby my river, where we loved each other much
Nearby my river, where we loved each other much"
Caracola,"The voice of the sea
Was held prisoner by the conch shell,
Because your heart hadn't gone
My heart enclosed it,
I love you, how I love you
The echo repeated to me Why, between sky and sea,
Between shadow and light, did I see your eyes?
Why did I feel
My heart quickly sinking that day? Why did you go to save me,
And I gave you the sea when the wave came?
Why did your love invade
My beach, that was so lonely yesterday? Thus your voice transformed
My heart into your conch shell Why did you go to save me,
And I gave you the sea when the wave came?
Why did your love invade
My beach, that was so lonely yesterday? Thus your voice transformed
My heart into your conch shell
Of love, of love"
't Is genoeg,"It’s enough
I have enough of all the games with fire
I have enough of all the beautiful compliments
And presents, it’s enough
I want to be happy
It’s enough What you promised me seemed so romantic
But soon that fairy tale appeared to be a deceptive appearance
And when you threw our love away that evening in May
That was enough Maybe you loved me
I was so happy with you
That my life I gladly wanted
To share with you But that you’re always lying
And cheating me consciously
Is unacceptable to a woman
Who, always faithful
Would tell you then: It’s enough
I have enough of all the games with fire
I have enough of all the beautiful compliments
And presents, it’s enough
I want to be happy It’s enough I’ve known many men and also illusions
I don’t believe in romances anymore, for a long time now
In the long term every adventure finds
Its ending in grief anyhow
That’s enough Yet I’m still dreaming of
A quite common man
One who sincerely and unrestrained
Can love me I’m tired of flirting
Ready for true love
Because I’m still a young woman
Who, always faithfully
Would tell him then: It’s enough
I have enough of all the games with fire
Even though you don’t give me any nice compliments
The moments of luck
You give them enough It’s enough, it’s enough
It’s enough"
I Belong,"I belong, I belong, I belong

Since half my life, my heart's been sleepin'
For all this time, my love's been keepin'

But now my heart has recovered
From past affairs that turned wrong
All my dreams are uncovered
I belong, I belong, I belong

At first, I thought - just one more lover
But then I found why he's like no other

And now my heart has recovered
From past affairs that turned wrong
All my dreams are uncovered
I belong, I belong, I belong

Too many hours slipped away
Too many loves came my way
But they only broke my heart in two
While it needed someone just like you

At last you came, and from now on
The two of us would be as one

Yes, now my heart has recovered
From past affairs that turned wrong
All my dreams are uncovered
I belong, I belong, I belong

I belong"

How good, how good, how good!
To know that happiness is waiting for me Hours seem like centuries, days seem like the eternity

To know that your kisses are now for me
How good, how good, how good!
How good the love I feel for you!
How good, how good, how good!

Walking the Streets in the Rain,"My poor heart feels like breaking
‘Cause I’ll never see you again
Still, nobody knows I am crying
‘Cause I’m walking the streets in the rain
My tears are mixed through the raindrops
And I feel like I can’t stand the pain
Still, nobody knows I am crying
‘Cause I’m walking the streets in the rain
I’m retracing your steps one by one
Oh, we walk down the street for so long
I can still see your face through my teardrops
While the rain whispers softly: “She’s gone”
The tears and the rain will keep falling
Till you bring back the sunshine again
Still, nobody knows I am crying
‘Cause I’m walking the streets in the rain
Still, nobody knows I am crying
‘Cause I’m walking the streets in the rain"
"Paradies, wo bist du?","First a look, then a word

Sunshine in the air
Flowers bloom, dreamlike and beautiful

Karusell,"Mum, I'm going to me meet Kjell
And Arne1 tonight
We're going to share a ticket for a ride
On an amusing roundabout Mum, whom should I take the first ride with?
Maybe Arne, for he's the taller one?
Yes, he's going to beat up Kjell
If he pulls my braid
Or calls me his smashing girl But once Arne and I go for a ride
Kjell will be so horribly mad
So I think it'll be best
If the three of us take a ride together
In a carriage that is big enough for that Mum, I'm in love with Kjell
So it goes without saying that I want to ride with him as well
Once we speed away
He's going to give me quite a hug
And so I'll let him take me home Poor Arne is for himself now
But I can't let that allow to bother me
I'm already busy
Taking care of myself2
When I'm flying around with Kjell When I'm flying around
When I'm flying around
When I'm flying around in our roundabout"
Als het weer lente is,"When it's springtime again

I'm counting the stars of April in the sky
I wanted to spend my life with you happily
I'll save the pearls of dew for you

That he must come as a friend
And we'll see
If my heart, if my heart keeps him
You'll know better than me
Where to find him in the night
You'll know better than me
How to talk to him as a friend
Go and tell love
That before his awakening
My days are just like
Days and days without sun
But why, but for whom
Are the flours of spring?
But why and for whom
Does my heart beat more often?
Go and tell love
That I'm seventeen years old
Tell him that while dreaming
I'm waiting for him, I'm waiting for him, I'm waiting for him
And that he must think of me for a long time"
Absent Friend,"A night of spring is a lovely thing
But I feel sad in this night of spring
For this is the time the sloe gets bright
And this is a most bewitching night
And I am lonely and you are far
And you can't hear what I sing

I wish I knew where you are tonight
I wish you're thinking of me tonight
Where are you tonight?
I wish you feel how I long for you
And I wish you're missing me too
And I wish I knew where to go
Knowing you
Knowing you

We ought to walk where the cowslips grow
Behind the hedge of candescent sloe
And you ought to smile and look at me
And I ought to kiss you tenderly
But I don't know if you still are mine
This lovely evening of spring

I wish I knew where you are tonight
I wish you're thinking of me tonight
Where are you tonight?

I wish you feel how I long for you
And I wish you're missing me too
And I wish I knew where to go
Knowing you
Knowing you

Sol de inverno,"God knows that I wanted to be happy with you
To live in the sunlight of your most tender look
Now your desire is dead, I live my own desire
Blooming spring in the winter sun
Dreams that I dreamt, where are they?
Hours that I lived, who has them?
What’s the use of having a heart, and not having anyone’s love? Kisses that I gave you, where are they?
Who have you given what belonged to me?
It’s better not to have a heart, than having it and not having it, like me I bartered everything in my life for nothing
Defeated flag, torn in the ground
I’m the forgotten date, the lost thing that goes on auction Dreams that I dreamt, where are they?
Hours that I lived, who has them?
What’s the use of having a heart, and not having anyone’s love?
I live of longings, my love, my life has lost the splendour
Like a winter sun I have no warmth What’s the use of having a heart, and not having anyone’s love?
I live of longings, my love, my life has lost the splendour
Like a winter sun I have no warmth"

While I'm offering resistance Every time it will be like back then
Every time I want want to give, you'd rather take But my dream is to love in friendship
I'm tired of my womanhood

But into men who are humans Because of you the comedy is over
Because of you it's time to take off the masks
Because of you your lover is making a fuss

Only a sound doll
Under my sunny blond hair
Wax doll, sound doll But one day I'll be living my songs
Wax doll, sound doll
Without fearing boys' warmth

Flying to the east I saw it and I understood

Paused in the sky
Until I saw a fading glimmer
A fire burning away I saw it and I understood
The time of love has gone

About the dawn of the morning of my longing for her Silently, the sea rustles now as if it wants to tell a story
With the whisper of silence about one love
Born here on the ground of the hot south Oh, tell me, sea, tell me
About the dawn of the morning of my longing for her
My deep longing for her"

I know an old man, someone who has lived for a long time
He's so kind asking me what has happened to me
And if the sun had burnt me I talk and seek comfort, he rocks in his chair
He says with a broken voice: ""There's nothing new under the sun"" But what does it matter if things happened before me?
But what does it matter if things happened before me?
No, what makes me hurt so much with all that he knew
That his eyes were sad What can expect myself in that rocking chair?
When he's so sad there now, there's nothing new under the sun"
Playboy,"Bright red cars, expensive leather seats
The latest model, I don’t trust you
Groupies, I don’t belong with them
You charm, you laugh, you tempt, angry fathers accuse you You’re a playboy, a slippery playboy
Certainly a playboy, but I won’t stick to your web
You’re a playboy, a slippery playboy
Certainly a playboy, but I won’t stick to your web Surfing, tennis and fencing
I only look for a moment, I don’t trust you
What about winter sports, girls, yes, and sledding
A St. Moriz winter is miserable without you You’re a playboy, the same playboy
A pretty playboy, but I won’t get on your sled
You’re a playboy, the same playboy
A pretty playboy, but I won’t get on your sled Many wealthy ladies, many debutantes
You deceive with a smile, I don’t trust you
Your name is linked with Double O Seven
The zeroes might be right, but not the seven You’re a playboy, a proper playboy
A real playboy, I can live without you
You’re a playboy, a proper playboy
A real playboy, I can live without you I can live without you"
Ele e ela,"I know who he is
He is a good guy
Maybe a little shy
He lived the dream of finding love
'Cause his heart desired more
More warmth She appeared
And her beauty
Caught him immediately
They love each other and now he says
That he achieved the greatest good in life,
He's happy. He thinks of her
All the time
He dreams about her
Through the night
He cries for her
If she doesn't show up He speaks only about her
Any time
He's got her
In his mind
He's nobody
Without her"
"Merci, Chérie","Thank you, thank you, thank you
For the hours, darling, darling, darling
Our love was beautiful, so beautiful, thank you, darling
Don't be sad, even though I have to leave you Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Your tears hurt, hurt so much, so much
Our dream flies away, away, thank you, darling
Don't cry, even this does make some sense Look ahead, don't look back, you can't force destiny
Because no sea is as wild as love
Only love can be like this
Can be like this, like this Thank you, thank you, thank you
For the hours, darling, darling, darling
Our love was beautiful, so beautiful, thank you, darling So beautiful, so beautiful, thank you, darling
So beautiful, so beautiful, thank you, darling"

Don't you see that I push myself against you?

That we are, you and I, brother and sister They say that love is blind
But I, I believe that it's deaf like you

After time, my heart has also grown

And you love me since that day
And we love each other since that day"

It is not possible,
to have in my arms
so much happiness.
To kiss your lips
that smell of wind.
We two, in love
like nobody in the world... God.., how I love you!
It makes me cry.
In all my life
I have never felt
a love so dear,
a love so true.

the swallows in the sky
that are going towards the sun,
who can change the love,
my love for you? God..., how I love you! A love so dear,
a love so true.

Chez nous,"In our country, in our country, in our country, in our country
In our country, in our country, in our country, in our country It is fortunate
That we met
When you came to visit us
During your last holidays When you crossed the Atlantic
You had, and that's quite classic
Romantic ideas
Of the people in our country As for a quite long time our old continent
Has not changed a lot in the eyes of strangers
In timeless ways
In Europe, the boys court the girls It doesn't keep us from loving each other
And we can, without any difficulty
Marry each other anyway
Like it is done in our country You'd like to take me with you over there
To the city where you were born
Where everything is large, too large, believe me
Where the walls don't seem to end I'd really like to follow you
But I have read in the books
That our country is still
The best place to live In our country, in our country, in our country, in our country
In our country, in our country, in our country, in our country Rather then the big cities
I prefer the calmness of a small village
Where we can have fun and dance
In the square in the summer nights All the differences
In our lives
Don't matter at all
When it's about being happy in our country In the street where I live
Everybody inivtes you
To quickly become
A child of our country In our country, in our country, in our country, in our country
In our country, in our country, in our country, in our country"

Come Back to Stay,"My love, I need your touch

Since you went away
I cried for you each night and day

The day you went away
I said I didn't mind
Now I know that you have left
A broken heart behind

Please, come back to stay
And promise me you'll never stray
I promise I'll be true
And that I'll never make you blue

A Man Without Love,"A man without love is only half a man
And half a man is nothing
A man without love cannot begin to dream
For all his dreams lead nowhere

That was me
The man I used to be
A lonely cloud who'd never found his destiny
Then you came
You touched my heart and told the pain to go
And now I know

A man who is loved has everything in life
And all his life is roses and rainbows and songbirds
That he knows never sang
For a man without love

That was me
The man I used to be
A lonely cloud who'd never found his destiny
Then you came
You touched my heart and told the pain to go
And now I know

A man who is loved has everything in life
And all his life is roses and rainbows and songbirds
That he knows never sang
For a man without love"

Jumping through the house and the streets
When a street musician, very elegantly
Bows to me with hat in hand
When I feel like drinking vodka in the morning
And clinking spontaneously with the baker

For a solemn dinner with the neighbours

Warum es hunderttausend Sterne gibt,"Why are there a hundred thousand stars
Why are there a hundred thousand stars
At night in the deep blue sky?
Why does someone often love someone else
Much more than anything else in the world?
Why do millions of flowers bloom
And does the sun shine for the poor and rich?
Is youth and dying
Here on earth equal for everyone?
What ever is destined for you
Take it as your destiny
Perhaps your heart realizes
This way, the real sense of life
Why are there a hundred thousand stars
At night in the deep blue sky?
Why are there always miracles?
Holds a heart often truely to another heart?
Why does also for the poor the springtime come
Often more beautiful than for the rich?
Because for God in heaven
Yes, everybody on earth is equal
Because for God in heaven
Yes, everybody on earth is equal"
Il doit faire beau là-bas,"(Chorus)
The weather must be good there
 in that beautiful country
 From my own window
 I see the rain falling As you left
 It was for being happy
 All the best if you’ve been successful
I hate all those people with whom you live without me
 I hate all those people who never speak to you about me It’s winter and the wind
 That I’ll go through
 It’s summer for you now (Chorus)
The weather must be good there
 In that beautiful country
 From my own window
 I see the rain falling Already four seasons
 Have passed over us
 And it rains on our house
I hate all those people with whom you live without me
 I hate all those people who never speak to me about you If you have to come back
 Don’t wait too long
 I can’t hold the time
The weather must be good there
 In that beautiful country
 From my own window
 I see life escaping Life…"
O vento mudou,"The wind changed
Listen, listen: the wind changed and she didn't return
The birds flew away, the leaves fell on the ground
She wanted to live and travel around the world
She promised to return if the wind changed
And the wind changed and she didn't return
I know that she lied, and ran away forever
Wind, if you can, bring me back her love
Because I'm going to die, without her by my side
Clouds, have mercy with this lonely me
Knock on her window, cry over her
And the clouds have cried, and when they came back
I knew that she lied, and ran away forever
Clouds, please cover my pain
Because I'm going to die, without her by my side
Listen! Listen! Listen! Listen! Listen!"
Quel cœur vas-tu briser?,"What heart will you break
Now that mine
has stopped beating for you?
What heart will you break?
Because I have nothing more
Nothing from you except for voiceless words What heart will you break
In giving her the hope
Of a dreamlike life for two? What heart will you break
In giving her beliefs
That only you can make her happy?
Happy It's so easy to make (someone) believe
In paths sown with flowers
Especially when we speak to a heart
That only asks to believe in it What heart will you break
Now that mine
No longer believes in anything, nor in you? What heart will you break
For the only vain pleasure
Of feeling that it lives under your law? What heart will you break
Following your path,
Believing that you're living your life? What heart will you break
For the rest of your life?
Yours, yours, yours"
Som en dröm,"Like a dream of a paradise

So ingeniously, without knowing where
Give me your hand and our dream will become real
Stretch your hand out to me My life with you is like a dream
In my dream, you mean everything to me
And you are the answers of my dream In my dream of an eternity
I found a reality
Yes, to me you are the answers of my dream You and I, we were looking for the same answers
So ingeniously, without knowing where
Give me your hand and our dream will become real
Stretch your hand out to me"
Varjoon – suojaan,"Into the shadow, from under the burning sun
Into the shadow, from the street of suffering
To safety, from under the glowing sky
To safety, to a lush oasis Above is sunshine, below is a burning land
In my mind is a shaded getaway, to which I can stroll alone Into the shadow, from under the burning sun
Into the shadow, I must soon go
To safety, from under the glowing sky
To safety, beneath the dense foliage* Into the shadow, shameless spotlights
Into the shadow, free of the famous
To safety, from a burning love
To safety, to a silent longing My life is restless, I’ve had all I can take
I’ve had enough of fame, peace is all I long for Into the shadow, I want to be out of the spotlight
Into the shadow, although I’ll be lonely there
To safety, I want peace finally
And then I’d be happy at last"

Puppet on a String,"[Chorus]
I wonder if one day that
You'll say that you care
If you say you love me madly
I'll gladly be there
Like a puppet on a string

[Verse 1]
Love is just like a merry-go-round
With all the fun of a fair
One day I'm feeling down on the ground
Then I'm up in the air
Are you leading me on?
Tomorrow will you be gone?

[Chorus]
I wonder if one day that
You'll say that you care
If you say you love me madly
I'll gladly be there
Like a puppet on a string

[Verse 2]
I may win on the roundabout
Then I'll lose on the swings
In or out, there is never a doubt
Just who's pulling the strings
I'm all tied up in you
But where's it leading me to?

[Chorus]
I wonder if one day that
You'll say that you care
If you say you love me madly
I'll gladly be there
Like a puppet on a string
I wonder if one day that
You'll say that you care
If you say you love me madly
I'll gladly be there
Like a puppet on a string

String"

Dukkemann,"There was a sweet little puppet man
One who was so free and perky and happy
He laughed at the other small puppets, he did, oh well... Because this peculiar puppet man
Thought he was as clever as only few are
He uttered that they were all attached to a string He laughed at the stupid small puppets who were dancing
On orders of something they didn't even understand
He laughed himself to tears, but suddenly he stopped
Because his string was cut in half And now look at our peculiar puppet man
He's understood now: If you want the dance to go on
You have to jump up and down1 on your string like everyone else He laughed at the stupid small puppets who were dancing
On orders of something they didn't even understand
He laughed himself to tears, but suddenly he stopped
Because his string was cut in half So our peculiar puppet man
Lost his life and he had to understand:
A string is attached to a spool, so if you want to be taken seriously2
You have to jump up and down on your string like everyone else"

Vse rože sveta,"Only a shot for greeting
And for farewell he disappeared into the night
In the middle of the grass field he is resting
Where he died without a word on his lips And I'm waiting for spring
I feel the soft hands of my darling
I feel her fondling of my hair and two words
Without words, in the middle of the grass field
When spring is here Why does this word of trumpet remind me of those people
Who don't have right words on their lips? Why is it that all these flowers
lie and rot in the middle of the field?
So that all those people
would feel time
And spring, that for every being
Happens only once in a lifetime"

If I Could Choose,"They envy me, my hills of Clare
The white gulls calling in the soft sea air
So much to lose
And yet I'd leave the hills of Clare
And live in a desert if I had you there
What would I lose if I could choose?

If I could choose a place to walk with you
I'd choose the longest road
And it would lead us to a house that no one knew
Bellows by the fire, and the turf smoke rising higher
Than the lark that wings and always sings of you

If I could choose a time to talk with you
I'd choose the longest day
And over all the hills of Clare, I'd shout the news
I would tell them how a day could last forever
And I'd never leave your side if I could choose

If I could choose a time to talk with you
I'd choose the longest day
And over all the hills of Clare, I'd shout the news
I would tell them how a day could last forever
And I'd never leave your side if I could choose"

Walking by, without looking to people
That I watch passing me by The summer is over
It was a dream that ended
I won’t think about it Therefore I leave this sadness
Drifting, rocked, by being certain
That the summer will return And the summer that I long to come near
Will surely bring me
What this summer took away"
Morgen,"Tomorrow
Tomorrow, just come soon now
That tomorrow, chooses you for a wife
That tomorrow, sun, happy and blue
What a day
Tomorrow, takes a night
That tomorrow, summery and soft
That tomorrow, sunlight and laugh
What a day
You're a night away from me
Day away from me, hour of my life
Such a time takes long without you
I was for a very long time underway
For a long time underway, an endless road
Such a time takes long without you
My far-away wife
Tomorrow, seemed like an idea
That tomorrow, you didn't come with me
That tomorrow, became a cliché
Of a day
Tomorrow, the grass will smell again
That tomorrow, when you were there
That tomorrow, sad farce
Of a day
You stayed that night away from me
Day away from me, stayed out of my life
The end came suddenly without you
I was in vain underway
For a long time underway, an endless road
The end came suddenly without you
You stayed a night away from me
Day away from me, stayed out of my life
The end came suddenly without you
I was in vain underway
For a long time underway, an endless road
The end came suddenly without you
My far-away wife"
Quand tu reviendras,"When you will come back
When you will come back, you who have left me
You who are so far away from me
A bird will tell me: ""Sing your bliss""
When you will come back, hasting you over there
Along our ancient roads
Showing your colours in the merlons of my heart
Weeks passing by, the days are lingering
And I'm waiting for your return
Spinning the wool in my beautiful finery
Embroiding my pain in soft threads of love
When you will come back, you who have left me
With a lot of hope in front of me
My love is waiting for you nearby a wood fire
Watch my tenderness on your standard
But before seeing you back
Me, poor princess, my heart in black
I'm turning incessantly my spinning wheel of hope
Because you will come back without ever leaving me again
And my heart will be satisfied
Because I love you, because I love you"
Tausend Fenster,"The town is already dressed for the night
It's a sea of light in the darkness
A great loneliness invades every house around that time of the day
It feels like we're living on small islands You don't even know who's living next to you
All of you don't know each other
In that very world of noise and light Thousands of windows in this town are brightly lit
And you keep asking yourself: ""Who's behind them?""
Thousands of windows tell you quietly: ""Someone's still living here""
""Someone just like you, just as lonely and alone"" Couldn't that person over there be the one
You've been dreaming of for years?
The one who might be your home?
But there's a sea of houses between you and him Tomorrow, your heart will still be just as empty
You'll still be eagerly hoping
Not to be so alone
In this grey world made of steel and stones Thousands of windows in this town are brightly lit
And you keep asking yourself: ""Who's behind them?""
Thousands of windows tell you quietly: ""Someone's still living here""
""Someone just like you, just as lonely and alone"""
Nous vivrons d'amour,"We'll live on love
By being wrong to chase away boredom
The time of loving and of skies of rain
Withered flowers or faded hearts
We see too many of those in life
But you and me, we'll live on love
Without making a step to a few detours
Yes, you and me, we'll live on love
Happy until the last day
I read my life in the depth of your eyes
And there I see myself always happier
I know that others have known these joys
And have cried more than once
But you and me, we'll live on love
Without making a step towards a few detours
Yes, you and me, we'll live on love
Happy until the last day
Yes, you and me, we'll live on love
We have the right to always love each other
We have the right to believe in love
Both of us, until the last day
Yes, you and me, we'll live on love
We have the right to always love each other"
Guardando il sole,"I would like, I would like
To be with you looking at the sun
I will pray, I will pray
To see the rainbow
And like this if another day dies
I will search again in your eyes
To find those words
You'll remember, they said I love you, I love you, I love you I would like, I would like
To weave my hands with yours
Even if there never was
A star in the sky for my love I would like, I would like
To weave my hands with yours
Even if there never was
A star in the sky for my love"
À chacun sa chanson,"To everyone his song, we want to sing about love
Every refrain is our everyday story
Whether it cries or laughs isn’t very important
What counts, in my opinion, is being two
Two in a song, two who play with love
Where one leaves without reason and the other awaits the return
To everyone his song, we want to sing about love
Unforced refrains, full of sentiments around them
I’m like the lovers of my refrains
Whether it cries or laughs like them, that doesn’t matter
The important thing is to love, to give everything, but in return
You meet yourself again in the heart of a refrain of love
La lala lala lala…
La lala lala lalalala lala…
To everyone his song, we want to sing about love
Every refrain is our everyday story
Unforced refrains, full of sentiments around them
To everyone his song, everyone his song of love
(To everyone his song, everyone his song of love)
To everyone his song, everyone his song of love
(To everyone his song, everyone his song of love)
To everyone his song, everyone his song of love

"Det börjar verka kärlek, banne mej","The day before yesterday I suddenly turned down the guys
When they invited me to a party
And then I spent a whole evening conversing
With your mother, being polite
It’s beginning to look like love, darn it
The kind of thing you see in the movies, imagine that
I guess I’m suspicious, but the thought crops up
But by all means, I could be wrong Last night I went with you and watched a tearjerker
Although I wanted to watch bang-bang
And then I sat listening to a string quartet
Me, I only used to like twang-twang It’s beginning to look like love, darn it
The kind of thing you read about in books, imagine that
I don’t understand it, I guess I’m a little stupid
But by all means, I could be wrong This morning I sang as I brushed my teeth
And then I began working like crazy
And then I called you about nothing at all
Just because I suddenly felt like it It’s beginning to look like love, darn it
The kind of thing that happens to others, imagine that
It all indicates, that I’m in love and all that
But by all means, I could be wrong It’s beginning to look like love, darn it
The kind of thing that happens to others, imagine that
It all indicates, that I’m in love and all that
But by all means, I could be wrong
I could be wrong"
Kun kello käy,"No more – no less, when I can see you closer
Just let me be here – I was once by your side so I want that now
But still its just my fear: As time passes by, the clock strikes too often
The night has soon ended, again the working week begins
As time passes by, soon I get to see it:
I don’t find you by my side, oh, why does time go so quickly? No more – no less, when I can see you closer
Let me be only here – I was once by your side so I want that now
But there is only my fear: As time passes by, and the morning pale returns
No stars shine, you leave with them
As time passes by, so I get older with it
Stay the time of love … oh, why can’t the clocks stop? Let me be only here – I was once by your side so I want that now

La source,"It sings in the middle of the wood
The spring, and I wonder
whether one should believe this legend
About a girl who was found there She was fair, she was gentle
She was fond of resting
In the woods, lying on the moss
Listening to the singing birds One day, when she went to town
Through the wood where she used to walk by
Suddenly she saw
Three men watching her
Three men watching her It sings in the middle of the wood
The spring, and I wonder
If one should believe this legend
About a girl who was found there The three were here waiting for her
Three wolfmen, for this sheep{2x}
Her flesh was too  tender
They were too hungry As she didn't know how to fight for
The light breath of her life
She fell down on the new grass
As a bird falls from its nest
As a bird falls from its nest It sings in the middle of the wood
The spring, and I wonder
If one should believe this legend
About a girl who was found there When she was picked up from the ground
As a big cut flower
Her white dress and the light,
She looked like a bride When she was picked up from the ground
It looked like a great bed
Among the leaves and the rocks
A clear spring gushed out
A clear spring gushed out It sings in the middle of the wood
The spring, and I wonder
Whether one should believe this legend
About a girl who was found there It sings in the middle of the wood
The spring, and I wonder
Whether one should believe this legend
About a girl who was found there Lai lai lai la la la lai la

Marianne,"Marianne, you make me happy for one moment
And then I won't live anymore, Marianne
What is that great desire that you must chase?
You never pause for a moment here with me Where are you going to? Where have you come from, my love?
Where are you going, stay by my side for a little while
If you sell your dreams for being able to dream
It might be that you spend your youth in hopelessness Marianne, you like flowers and you never notice
That I love you, Marianne Marianne Where are you going to? Where have you come from, my love?
Where are you going, stay by my side for a little while

Chance of a Lifetime,"One day, while I was out walking
I saw your face in the midst of a crowd
Here, I thought, is the chance of a lifetime
I thought you'd stepped from a cloud
Think of that wonderful meeting
Oh, the sun shone down on us from above
Why should I be out walking that day and get
The chance of a lifetime of love?
Show me the way you are feeling
Always tell me just what I should know
Oh, a guiding hand must have brought us together
But now that seems so long ago
You are the one I have dreamt of
Oh, I never thought my dreams would come true
All I want is the chance of a lifetime
The chance of a lifetime with you
Show me the way you are feeling
Always tell me just what I should know
Oh, a guiding hand must have brought us together
But now that seems so long ago
You are the one I have dreamt of
I never thought my dreams would come true
All I want is the chance of a lifetime
The chance of a lifetime with you
All I want is the chance of a lifetime
The chance of a lifetime with you"

Catherine,"Catherine, Catherine, we were ten years old
do you remember, Catherine, in the school*?
I offered you my tartines** and my chocolates
with my heart, Catherine, already in love. And when night closed the school
my child's heart would break
you left me alone with my heartache
you were dreaming about a charming prince If I laughed Catherine, was because in my heart
there were laughs, Catherine, sad as tears Where were you and the charming prince,
have you already found him?
there will always be our hearts and names
carved in the kindergarten's tree. Catherine, Catherine, in the school
Catherine, Catherine, we were 10 years old Catherine, Catherine, I often dream
in front of others Catherine in the school
Catherine, Catherine and despite the time
I wait for you Catherine as before

Vivo cantando,"(Pa para para papa...)
(Pa para para papa...) How many nights I wandered
Through a thousand endless paths?
How many nights I kept silent
About what I wanted to say?
A deep hope
And a faraway echo was talking about you Today that you came to my life
I only sing for you Since you arrived, I don't live by crying
I live by singing, I live by dreaming
I just want you to tell me what's happening
Because I'm trembling when I'm by your side Since you arrived, I don't live by crying (hey)
I live by singing (hey), I live by dreaming (hey)
But I wonder how long I could keep
Your love deep inside of me (Pa para para papa...)

And I was the commander, left for the islands of the wind
You were proud of me, Mom Mom, Mom, I had a marvelous dream But suddenly my childhood dream stops
And I see appearing the real adult life
I have time, I have time Mom, Mom, I had a bad dream

The Wages of Love,"Look before you leap right into love, my friend
It cannot be bought so very cheap, my friend
Love that makes you laugh
Love that makes you cry
Before you really understand it
It can make you live, it can make you die
There will be bridges to be crossed
And there'll be teardrops to be lost
Or you will have to pay the cost
Just wait and see, oh yeah
There are many rainbows on the way
Days are maybe bright or maybe grey
So when you fall in love, you pay
The wages of love
The wages of love
The wages of love
Just take my advice, don't be a fool, my friend
When you fall in love, you go to school, my friend
Lessons must get learned
Fingers must get burned
Before you really understand it
Love is very nice if you pay the price
There will be bridges to be crossed
And there'll be teardrops to be lost
Or you will have to pay the cost
Just wait and see, oh yeah
There are many rainbows on the way (On the way)
Days are maybe bright or maybe grey (Maybe grey)
So when you fall in love, you pay
The wages of love
The wages of love
The wages of love
There will be bridges to be crossed (To be crossed)
And there'll be teardrops to be lost (To be lost)
Or you will have to pay the cost
Just wait and see
There are many rainbows on the way (On the way)
Days are maybe bright or maybe grey (Maybe grey)
So when you fall in love, you pay
The wages of love
The wages of love
The wages of love"
Due grosse lacrime bianche,"Our heart you always said
It's not a room to rent
We separate, the room is empty
The open door remains Two large white tears
Like two pearls of the sea
That is all what I have left of you From love, no, you cannot die
To not hear your voice
I will hide my head under the pillow Like a flash which opens the sky
I saw light inside darkness
Just from love, no, you cannot die
Laughing, you told me that Two large white tears
Like two pearls of the sea
That is all what I have left of you Two large white tears
will not make a dripping sound
Because the last ones, you know, aren't heavy"

Heard his song of adventure,
Belonged to the nightly kitchen fire,

A dude song of his own,

His own song, his own voice,
Yet the death goes his own way,

Jennifer Jennings,"London city, was dreaming still in the sun
Dreaming of the sea, in the sunshine around me
Where I went, along the borders of the garden
the trees stood sweetly in the sunshine And then you came, Jennifer Jennings
Dancing sweetly as the spring before me
You came, Jennifer Jennings
And blue eyes, they were laughing at me
At me, only at me You took me through the city then,
Along the dreams you had, soft as silk,
and since then my dreams always return
to all those dreams of before, of you and mee And then you came, Jennifer Jennings
So fresh and playfull as the spring, so happy
Because you, Jennifer Jennings
You're exactly what I dreamt for me Yes, you came, Jennifer Jennings
And blue eyes, they were laughing at me
But you, Jennifer Jennings
you kept dancing always and always past me
past me, always past me Kept on passing me
Hopelessly past me"

And it only belongs to the lovers ""Good day, good day"", fortune says and it comes to us
In your arms I fly into the sky
I also know, that after the lucky time
Only loneliness will remain Good evening, good evening, it was wonderful to see you again
Though it's hard for me to leave you such in love
I dream of you till you come back and then I only say:
""Good day, good day"""
"Oj, oj, oj, så glad jeg skal bli","Holy moly1, I'm going to be so happy
Once there is nobody with him anymore
Holy moly, there's going to be a party
And I'll be the only guest Holy moly, I'm going to be so happy
Once I'm able to release my competitors
Holy moly, being alone with you
Yes, that's the best thing in life I could imagine I've got the most attractive guy in the world, that's obvious
But he's got too much of an appetite for mini-skirt offerings2
He's running after Eva, Lise and Anne
He's frolicking just like a fish in water But every time he gets ready to swim another round
I've got a heartfelt dream: Holy moly, I'm going to be so happy
Once there is nobody with him anymore
Holy moly, there's going to be a party
And I'll be the only guest Holy moly, I'm going to be so happy
Once I'm able to release my competitors
Holy moly, being alone with you
Yes, that's the best thing in life I could imagine La, la, la... Holy moly!"

Little porcelain figurine, why are you alone?

You dance on your musical clock
And must always be lonely Primaballerina, Primaballerina
Primaballerina, music is your world

Turn to the chimes
You only feel lucky when you dance You look pretty in your white dress
You have to pirouette, but never in a pair
Tell me, does your heart cry
When the nightingale sings a song for her lover?
Lalala... lalalala lalala...
Tell me, does your heart cry
When the nightingale sings a song for her lover? Primaballerina, Primaballerina

"Un jour, un enfant","A day will dawn
Over three branches of lilacs
That a child will behold
Just like a picture book The world around him
Will be empty, and so
He'll imagine life
From a blank page By drawing the shape of an orange
He'll give the sky its first sun
By drawing the bird
He'll invent the flowers
By searching the sound of the water
He'll hear the cry of the heart By drawing the points of a star
This very child will find the path
Of the grown people who still
Look amazed
At the fruits of every day
And at the roses of love"
Desfolhada portuguesa,"Body of line, lips of must
My handsome body, my lit fire
Threshing-floor of corn, moonlight of August
Who bears a child, does it out of love It is corn-king, red corn
Clove of meat, little grape of love
Son of a king who being old
Returns to be born when there is heat My spoken word to the nascent sunlight
My madrigal of dawn
Love, love, love, love, love present
In each defoliated ear My root of green pine
My blue sky touching the mountain range
Oh my heartache and my thirst
Oh sea to the south of my land It is blonde wheat, it is beyond Tagus
My country in this movement
The sun burns it, the wind kisses it
It will harvest crazily in movement My spoken word to the nascent sunlight
My madrigal of dawn
Love, love, love, love, love present
In each defoliated ear Eyes of almond, dark cistern
Where the misadventure is covered with porch
Hidden fury, enchanted fury
Lost legend, found legend Oh my land, my adventure
Helpless shell of us
Oh my land, my faraway place
For me lost, for me found"
Kuin silloin ennen,"Only two
Christmas presents,
only two
I'd wish for Just a small moment
to take a breather
and definitely
peace of mind I only wish
for Christmas magic
I wish our hearts
don't worry at least for a while
and Christmas brings that hopeful moment If only with
the mild night wind
Christmas would
bring once again some peace of mind
to this confused world of ours Why should I
wish for gold
more unneeded
odds and ends Would those bring that
moment of rest
which feels like
forgiveness"
Waterman,"Aquarius
Aquarius, are you an Aquarius?

Intuitively, I already love you

From now on you belong to me

My dearest man, that's what you are
Sign of the zodiac, that doesn't play with hearts
But that wants to help people, always
You just don't know a rough dominant tone
You always look for warm humanity

From now on you belong to me
Aquarius, gentle Waterman
My dearest man, that's what you are
Aquarius, my sign and talisman
From now on you belong to me

Always faithful and solidary
But also often so credulous
And somewhat deaf to evil
Sometimes so serious, almost shy
But endlessly affectionate

We'll go together on a journey to a city that I don't know of
So many springs to come, that will make us happy Eyes of a girl, I speak to them with love's silence
And I risk in saying so many things that my mouth won't say
When you wake up in the morning, the whole sun is in your eyes
When night falls, the night from your eyes
There is a light that takes me to you One day in them I will find
What it is you're hiding Eyes of a girl, this journey sooner or later, will have ended
An empty beach without a sea, I'll have to see in you
Eyes of a girl, how many bad things will you forgive me

That I'll receive from you"

Marie-Blanche,"It's the time that the frosty pearls settle
 	That every leaf thinks to be a rose
 	Somewhere a bird sings something
 	And Marie-Blanche is mine We're there in a soft stillness
 	We've put an end to our loneliness
 	Our bodies learn tender habits
 	And Marie-Blanche is mine And Marie-Blanche is mine, and I love her
 	And Marie-Blanche falls asleep near me The snow falls and the wind escorts her
 	Every pond is frozen, yes, but what does it matter
 	In the winter we closed our door
 	And Marie-Blanche is mine And Marie-Blanche is mine, and I love her
 	And Marie-Blanche falls asleep near me Oh, may the time turn its pages
 	We'll stay there for a century or longer
 	The city sleeps under the wing of white clouds
 	And Marie-Blanche is mine I don't want to know a thing about the rest of the world
 	The earth never seemed so round to me
 	Against my heart, there's her blonde hair

"Knock, Knock Who's There?","Tears of rain
Run down my window pane
I'm on my own again
Good evening, sorrow

Sit and dream
Of how things might have been
And as I close my eyes
I get the strangest feeling

Knock, knock - ""Who's there?""
Could this be love that's calling?
The door is always open wide

Knock, knock - ""Who's there?""
Now as the night is falling
Take off your coat and come inside

Climb the stair
And then I say a prayer
For someone who could share
My situation

But instead
As I lay down my head
I have to leave it all
To my imagination

Knock, knock - ""Who's there?""
Could this be love that's calling?
The door is always open wide

Knock, knock - ""Who's there?""
Now as the night is falling
Take off your coat and come inside

Lalala lalala lalala...

Je suis tombé du ciel,"I fell from heaven
I lived well up there in my clouds
My heart and my head were travelling
I felt I was quiet for a long time
For a long time
Everytime I looked at the earth
I found it very round and very hard
I didn't want to see people
But suddenly, one day, while seeing you
I fell from heaven to bend me over you
Arriving from heaven, I fell on you
Approaching you, gave me wings
I fell from heaven and I'm mad with joy
I'll never go back to the clouds
You're my city and you're my village
I've discovered that the only paradise
Is here
I pray that they will be bored when they sore up there
To live alone like a sad stay-at-home
When it's enough to dive in your eyes
To navigate in the middle of the blue sky
I fell from heaven to bend me over you
Arriving from heaven, I fell on you
Approaching you, gave me wings
I fell from heaven and I'm mad with joy
La la la la la la... la la la la la la...
La la la la la la... and I am mad with joy"
Gwendolyne,"Gwendolyne
So deep inside of me
I keep the warmth
Which you make me feel
I keep your love
So deep inside of me
That I can still live
Dying for love
Dying for you
Like the waves that searches the sea shore
Like the sailor that searches his harbour and his home
I have searched in my soul, willing to find you
And I only found my loneliness
And although you're far away, so far away from me
Although other kisses, maybe, Gwendolyne
You still remember the time of our love
You still remember me
And I still remember that yesterday
When you were by my side
You were talking about love
I could still smile
I still remember that love
And now you go away from me
I've asked the silence to talk to me about you
I've wandered in the night, wanting to hear you
And I heard the whisper of the wind say
Your name, Gwendolyne"
Marlène,"A low and nostalgic voice
In my heart sings music
Old-fashioned music
With that, I always return
To the time of the seventy-eight record
Scratched and forgotten It was you who charmed, Marlene
Who overwhelmed, Marlene, it was you
You weren't the queen of the screen to me, Marlene
But the Blue Angel1 that will never be forgotten Long fingers, a lit cigarette
A glance that never ended
Doesn't know, doesn't know its end
Your black stockings in Cinerama2
A silhouette in sexyrama, Marlene
Yes, it's you You smile and I'm Marlene
People shout: ""Marlene!"" – it's for me
I dream of a stairway on the scene like you, Marlene
That I descend languorously One metre fifty with my heels
Curly hair like a sheep
Oh, what a disillusion
I wanted to resemble her so much
To bewitch you, to 'Marlenise' you
The Blue Angel, for me it failed She said: ""Love, that's my life""
""I'm only fond of that""
No, no, I can't
""You take me, take me in the sky""
""You make me crazy in my mind""
I could never...
""I want you, I love you, darling""
""I've got you""
I could never, never sing like that"
Wunder gibt es immer wieder,"Miracles keep happening, again and again
A lot of people ask: what's the reason?
Why does happiness never come to me?
Making far too little of life
When all the time happiness is near
Miracles keep happening, again and again
Today or tomorrow they can occur
Miracles keep happening, again and again
When one happens to you, you also have to see it
Many people seek each and every day
Someone who gives his heart to you
And just when they're thinking he will never come
They find someone who loves them
Miracles keep happening, again and again
Today or tomorrow they can occur
Miracles keep happening, again and again
When one happens to you, you also have to see it

Musik,"Wherever you look
There are people making music
Often, it's sold as something it really is not But then it's wrapped up nicely
With some lights on top
And it's shipped as an escape into paradise It's not the light, not the gloss
It's not the show what music is about
Like the wind, like a dream
It's supposed to be the language of imagination and freedom The language that we talk in
Is by no means enough
To tell somebody else what you feel That's why we've invented music
It'll never by anything else
All the commotion surrounding it will make me crazy one day It's not the light, not the gloss
It's not the show what music is about
Like the wind, like a dream
It's supposed to be the language of imagination and freedom It's not the light, not the gloss
It's not the show what music is about
Like the wind, like a dream

Diese Welt,"Clear, starry night,
and the air is like jasmine;
rivers like crystal they are so clear,
and forests luscious green.
Can this still be,
or is it already too late
that for everyone everywhere
this dream is fulfilled? [Chorus:]
This world, this world,
has given us our lives.
It is yours, it is mine,
it is beautiful to live in;
what will happen, depends on you. Smoke from a thousand chimneys
descends on town and countryside.
Where yesterday there were children,
today the beach is covered in oil.
In the great jets,
we fly towards tomorrow.
How will this tomorrow be,
pointless or full of sunshine? Chorus x2 And it is just a speck of dust
in the infinite,
only this star is our star,
the others are much too far away."

Just love won't die in time At the end of the road
All the dreams that you have inside will come true
If in some point of your road
You have filled your life with love and truth At the end of the road
You can find the good you hoped to feel
Forget the past, because it won't come back
Keep the love you have in you At the end of the road
There I'll be awakening, to start living again
If in some point of your road
You have filled your life with love and truth At the end of the road
You'll have inside the faith and the joy of living

Un jardin sur la terre,"By the strength of running to not discover anything
To only be an adventurer in your memories
Or to take trips the way you do business
And to lose your youth the way you win a war You can say to yourself
That nothing is important
That you have nothing more to say
That you've lost your time A garden on earth, a little lost corner
Just a trunk of misery, a shelter, nothing more
A garden on earth to cultivate your heart
And to take the better that there is to the ephemeral Sowing, being certain that you give your life
From the seed to the bud and from the flower to the fruit
A garden on earth, an Eden before time
A garden on earth, is this not happiness? By the strength of wanting to live in two for life
At the point of coupling yourself with whomever
Or making multiple battlefields your bed
Collecting hearts for lack of medals You can say to yourself
That nothing is important
That you have nothing more to say
That you've lost your time A garden on earth, a little lost corner
Just a trunk of misery, a shelter, nothing more
A garden on earth to cultivate your heart
And to take the better that there is to the ephemeral Sowing, being certain that you give your life
From the seed to the bud and from the flower to the fruit

You said that the one that can tear us apart will never be born Love is a moment, love is a moment
But life is a storm, stronger than us And go, sadness, go, for her there is a thought and a tear
Goodbye, good luck, you'll see the wounds will heal
Who knows if there will be a flower for you under the snow Who knows if there will be a flower for you under the snow"
Vita vidder,"Sunny beaches, green palm trees swaying
Mediterranean countries, dark nights, warm, nice
That's where you want to live, but I've got a different paradise White sceneries, glittering snow
Snow-covered mountains as far as the eye can see
Deep forests, pewits and rabbits
An everlasting sun that never goes down Here's my world and I want to share it with you
If you want to be on my side
You want to be on my side If only the two of us get along, the world is ours
Sun at a beach or sun over a snow white winter land Foggy winds leave small traces in the sand
Mediterranean winds taking our boat towards the beach
That's how you want to live, but I've got a different paradise Snow that is swirling around my skis
Downhill along steep vertiginous slopes
Gliding down the mountain crests
Alone between the sky and the depth That's how my world is and I want to share it with you
If you want to be on my side
You want to be on my side If only the two of us get along, the world is ours"
One Day Love,"You love for a day
Then you go on your way
Breaking hearts, lonely hearts
Though they want you to stay
Then you laugh, how you laugh
When the tears start to fall
Turn your back, one day love
Wave your hand to them all
Yesterday, lovely day
I was yours for a while
In your arms there was peace
As you kissed with a smile
Words of love, empty words
Whispered close to my ear
They were lies, only lies
But I held them so dear
How can you be so deceiving?
Why do you injure my pride?
Building me up with your promises
Only to throw me aside
How many hearts have you broken
Closing your ears to their cries?
How many times have you cheated and lied
With a look of deceit in your eyes?
One day soon, very soon
Deep in love you will fall
And the one that you want
Will not answer your call
So beware and have care
Take advice from a friend
Your kind of love, one day love
Will come to an end
How can you be so deceiving?
Why do you injure my pride?
Building me up with your promises
Only to throw me aside
How many hearts have you broken
Closing your ears to their cries?
How many times have you cheated and lied
With a look of deceit in your eyes?
One day soon, very soon
Deep in love you will fall
And the one that you want
Will not answer your call
So beware and have care
Take advice from a friend
Your kind of love, one day love
Will end"
Tijd,"Saskia has a name with a ring to it1
She works at a beer hall2
Pours beer for the boys3
The boys think she's good
The boys think
She's good4 Then there's nothing more to it
Saskia, she is crosseyed, you see
Although her eyes are5 clear and bright
It attracts ridicule from everyone6
It attracts ridicule
From everyone She is quiet and unnoticed
Her uniform is starched
But she was beautiful, and when she smiled7
In a way that made you gasp
In a way that
Made you gasp I let my eyes8 go exploring her
And it was actually worth the effort
The more they saw, the more they found
She was indeed incredibly good-looking9
She was indeed
Incredibly good-looking After I had strengthened myself with a beer
I said ""Miss, have you noticed?
Has it not yet struck you
That I have been observing10 you?
That I have been
Observing you"" She said ""Sir, that's true
The reason is unknown to me""
Then I mustered up my courage and said
""When will you get off work, Saskia?
When will you get off work,
Saskia?"" We watched a movie about romance
Then we had coffee at a café
I walked her to her home11
In our hearts a light12 was burning
In our hearts
A light was burning Saskia had her bed in an alcove13
And she was beautiful when she slept
And we were more than just awake14
When her alarm clock sounded
When her alarm
Clock sounded Saskia is a name that has a ring to it
She works at a beer hall
Her eyes are crossed, wherever she looks
But she is beautiful when she smiles
Yes, she's beautiful
When she smiles"

Tvoj dječak je tužan,"I still think of the one who
Doesn’t sleep beside me anymore
The night is long and dark like pain
The bed is empty, and so is the table I don’t know where she lives and whether she knows
That I still dream of her, somewhere without her
Because someone else is with her on a faraway journey
To the stars and beyond, without me In some garden, you’re still a rose
While I can’t sleep, you know I’m feeling sad Don’t call me anymore, you know that
My journey is over without you In another garden, you’re still a rose

Lykken er...,"There is happiness on earth
Just not where you expect
It’s not money in the bank, a tiger in your petrol-tank
Happiness is all you wish for
Happiness is a bucket of sand
In the small hand of a child
Happiness is a greeting from the gang, breakfast in bed
Happiness is herring in dill If you look around, a thousand things
Will give you some of the happiness you seek
Yes, it exists where you are
It’s only you it’s waiting for Happiness is an old hat
Which used to belong to your best friend
Happiness is an hour in the bath, warm chocolate
Happiness is this and that Happiness is crystal clear water
Your fingers in sand hot from the sun
Walking barefoot in the grass, with no address
Happiness is you and me Happiness is to celebrate the end of high school
And to catch the last bus
Happiness is among the trees in the park, hearts on a tree-bark
Happiness is living it up If you sing a song, try for once
To pretend it was written to you
Try this one, happiness is
After all, something you seek along the way Happiness is a milk tooth
In a small glass of water
Getting tax money back, letting in the cat
Happiness is such and so Happiness is like a wind
Like a sunbeam in your heart
Happiness is the content of the song, small details
Happiness is yours and mine Happiness is like a wind
Like a sunbeam in your heart
Happiness is the content of the song, small details

Ceol an ghrá,"The Music of Love
Listen, listen, I hear it again, the music of love
Here or beyond me, it's eternally with me, the music of love
In the centre of the lovely city, beside the river or on the beach
I hear the tune, you are my sweetheart, that's the music of love
Listen, listen, I hear it again, the music of love
The little bird sings it, the wind plays it for me, the music of love
Morning or midday, I always hear it
Listen to the tune, you are my sweetheart, that's the music of love
This is the Land of Eternal Youth and wings are in place of my legs
Now and forever happiness is before me, all around
You are my sweetheart by day and by night
And every single moment of my life
Listen, listen, I hear it again, the music of love

People walks close to my loneliness non-stop
It's dawning
But it seems like the sky became grey for us
Since the sad moment when I heard your goodbye. I know a place, beyond the sea
Where the day shines brighter in the dawn
Our ship will go towards to that light
By the sea of your trust
With winds of hope in the tomorrow. Listen, let's try to start all over again today, why not?
If you want it, friendship and love will be our flag
It's dawning
Let's look, let's look in the sky for new blues
Let's win the battle to our misunderstanding"
"Beg, Steal or Borrow","You know I'll beg steal or borrow

And knowing how much you care, I'll be there forever

You know I'll beg, steal or borrow to give you sunny days
And in a hundred ways I'll bring you love
You know I beg steal or borrow
(Yes, I will)
To make your garden grow
And most of all you know, I bring you love love love
I always knew that the world would be a finer place
So what if I have to wait, better late than never
You you're like me, and you believe love makes it all worthwhile
And although we've just begun, we'll go on forever

There are days better than you expect
Cut down on your demands, stop all the stressing
Relax and smile, there is no doubt that

A festa da vida,"May come the sun, the wine, the flowers
Tides, songs, all colours
May wars be forgotten thanks to love
May already come the embraces
Put on the smile of a clown
Forget sadness and tiredness May come all the parties
And may nobody forget the kisses
May come the gifts of joy
And may the party last until daybreak May no expenses be spared
May all sadness be kept far away
May there be bread, wine and roses on the table May blankets and rugs be brought along
May the wine flow in our throats
And may the party last all night long May everyone come out of free will
May all longing be forgotten
May young and old people come
Without giving me any advice May everyone come out of free will
May all longing be forgotten
May young and old people come
Without giving me any advice"
C'est la chanson de mon amour,"It's the song of my love
Wild and tender words
It's the song of my love
My heart was charmed
By the song of my love
My love
She's there throughout my life
She waits for me in the wind and under the rain
In the blue of a blue sky in full noon
In my boring night so far from him
One day, it was December
I went alone under the rain
We've found each other
To share the same shelter
His hand took mine
We loved each other the same day
Time, hope, sorrow
It's the song of my love
My love
She's there throughout my life
She waits for me in the wind and under the rain
In the blue of a blue sky in full noon
In my boring night so far from him
Wild and tender words
It's the song of my love
My heart was charmed
By the song of my love
Di di di da da... di di da da da di da da...
My heart was charmed
By the song of my love

L-imħabba,"I searched for wise men, philosophers and poets
So I could ask them this question:
“What is youth’s big love?”
I felt the answer in my heart
Love is a kiss, a kiss, a kiss
Something that touches your heart and they call it “kiss”
Love is a kiss as sweet as sugar
That is pushed by the lips while the eyes are shut And while the heart beats with enthusiasm
And feels the veins burn with fire
Whether it’s given straight or it’s stolen
In the middle of the night, in the harshest of the day I went to find the freaks, Hell’s Angels and the hippies
And I also asked them my question
I always got the same answer from them
And then in the words of all these I came to: Love is a kiss, a kiss, a kiss
Something that touches your heart and they call it “kiss”
Love is a kiss as sweet as sugar
That is pushed by the lips while the eyes are shut And while the heart beats with enthusiasm
And feels the veins burn with fire
Whether it’s given straight or it’s stolen
In the middle of the night, in the harshest of the day Love is a kiss, a kiss, a kiss
Something that touches your heart and they call it “kiss”
Love is a kiss as sweet as sugar
That is pushed by the lips while the eyes are shut The Italians and also the Spanish
The German, English and Maltese
I asked them all what they understood under love
And their answer is this: Love is a kiss, a kiss and a kiss"
Muistathan,"Do you remember
Do you remember that sweetest night
The lovely day and the beautiful evening
The moment, when you took my hand first time
To your own warm hand
We walked together only a while
Through a little park, over an old bridge
That little moment was enough to give us happiness then
We met amid the crowd
A coincidence? No, I know it
Destiny brought love in front of us and the land of happiness
Even sorrow is partly happiness
It just has to be realized as part of life
Why would a human otherwise have a skill to laugh?
We walked together only a while
Through a little park, over an old bridge
That little moment was enough to give us happiness then
Did I see you in a dream before?
I think that was the reason for my feeling
I have earlier lived a little moment too
All that must still be just a dream
Park, bridge, and the warm hand of yours
In a second I lived a life almost eternal

Falter im Wind,"Butterfly in the wind
Don't stay in the woods, butterfly

Your colours flame up
The night is dead, in your dance
Life is bright like the day
Don't fall into the sun

Butterfly in the wind, like the time passing by
Like sand in the hand, blown away, burnt

A whisper promises the light
Your day is bright, so dance quickly
It lasts just a wingbeat
Dance around the lights, butterfly
Soon the evening fog will come
Don't fall into the sun
Don't fall into the sun
Don't fall into the sun
Butterfly in the wind, like the time passing by
Like sand in the hand, blown away, burnt

A whisper promises the light

I giorni dell'arcobaleno,"Those where the days
of the rainbow,
at the end of winter
the sunny weather would come back again. And you in your eyes
had the moon and the stars,
you felt a hand
touching lightly your skin. And while you were going crazy
with the smell of the flowers
the night was lighting
with a thousand colors. Lying on the grass
like someone who's dreaming,
you laid down as a child
and stood up as a woman. Now you see yourself
a bit older,
you grew stronger and self-confident.
And your sweet adventure has already started. Now your former friends
are just children
they get together to play
and they still dream on a ray of moonlight. You are living
as if you are an important woman
because at 15 years old
you've already had a lover. But one day you'll see
that every woman is mature
at the right time
and in the right way. And in your race
towards Love
you are leaving back
the best days. Those where the days
of the rainbow,
at the end of winter
the sunny weather would come back again."
Muzika i ti,"Everyone builds their own world themselves
Everyone dreams their own dreams themselves
Their own road which leads love
That leads to happiness, everyone finds it themselves Music and you, that is the world
In which I found happiness
Music and you, that is the world
In which the sun shines bright
Like a beautiful vision from a dream
Whoever is happy I surrender myself
Music and you, music and you
The anthem of an eternal love That day it has to come once
Your day, your lucky night
And the pain which you carry
Deep in your heart, it has to get better sometimes Music and you, that is the world
In which I found happiness
Music and you, that is the world
In which the sun shines bright
Like a beautiful vision from a dream
In which I happily surrender myself to
Music and you, music and you
The anthem of an eternal love Music and you, music and you
The anthem of an eternal love"

Steaming waves and white crests
Blown out sails

Dipping in the water, having a good time on the sun-warmed rocks
Before we're heading home at a leisurely pace
Across the island in a lovely summer night Hum a song, troll a melody

He has his head full of violins
She has a pounding heart because she already knows
How he will take her in his arms

How we love each other, my love
The poem of 'I love you'
Is the same every day
How we love each other, how we love each other

They had dreamt so long about each other
They finally found each other
Lovers of Paris, from the North or from the South of France
Two by two, they smiled delighted
Lovers from everywhere, they come to us
Singing the song in unison

À la folie ou pas du tout,"I feel the booms and the bangs
beating in my wounded heart
Love like a boomerang
returns me to the days of the past
into the cry of madness

I have on the tip of my tongue
your name, almost erased,
twisted like a boomerang
My mind rejected it
from my memory, as  the drinking
and your love have exhausted me
I feel the booms and the bangs
beating in my wounded heart
Love like a boomerang
returns me to the days of the past
in which  we loved like crazy
as two raving mad
Remember that a bloodless heart
might stop one day
If like a boomerang
you won‘t come searching for me
little by little I will fall to the pieces
Victim of your cruelty
I feel the booms and the bangs
beating in my wounded heart
Love like a boomerang
returns me to the days of the past

ready to die for you
You, part of a gang
of my past lovers
beware that a boomerang
It could make you pay for
all the loony torments
you made me suffer
I feel the booms and the bangs
beating in my wounded heart
Love like a boomerang
returns me to the days of the past
This is a crazy history
A story not worth of the tears
My reason sways and staggers
it is ready to be overturned
Under the blows of a boomerang
flashback ties me down
And if one day I would shoot myself
It is you, why I should

beating in my wounded heart
Love like a boomerang
returns me to the days of the past

This is not your fault
But,  however, you must know That after you
I will not be able to live anymore, to live no more
That in remembering you
After you,
I will have wet eyes
The empty hands, the heart without joy.
With you,
I had learned how to laugh
And my laughter comes only by you.
After you, I will be only a shadow...
Of your shadow....
After you... Even a day, if I make my life,
If I hold the promise
Who links two beings (perhaps) forever
After you
I might be able
To give my tenderness
But not my love After you
I will not be able to live anymore, to live no more
That in remembering you
After you,
I will have wet eyes
The empty hands, the heart without joy.
With you,
I had learned how to laugh
And my laughter comes only by you.
After you, I will be only a shadow...
Of your shadow....

And everything to you is intriguing
But tell who coulda known
That I would succeed like this [Bridge: Grow-ah]
Balkaton [Hook: Sandra Africa]
And now you are here, everything you would like to know
And everything to you is imposing
But tell who coulda known
That one day life will be gold
And now you are here, everything you would like to know
And everything to you is intriguing
But tell who coulda known
That I would succeed like this [Outro: Grow-ah]

Vaihtaa saat pois ilmeesi harmaan

Tell me a thousand times

It's just like porcelain
Oh... breaks in your hand
Before it can be completed
Let us be together Baby, baby, I love you
I love you, yes, my love
It's so fine being together
But the seperation doesn't hurt Though I know
A woman can do nothing alone
Oh... love happens
Only with two together
Let us be together Sometimes love is only love pain
Even though you wished it could be different Baby, baby - what's the matter now?

Tourada,"Bullfight
It doesn't matter, sun or shade
Cabins or barriers
We fight the beasts shoulder to shoulder
Nobody deceives us
We fight hand in hand
Only waiting can hurt us
Bells, cowbells and capes are coming in
And black mantillas
Swords, big horns and defeats are coming in
And some poets
Brave people, carnations and swear words are coming in
Because it's a wheeze at most
Cows are coming in behind the forcados
Who don't fit at all
Bravos and olés of the yokels
Who pay nothing are sounding
And only the bullfighter's helpers are left
Whose job doesn't fit
With hopeful banderillas
We keep off the beast
We're in the Spring Bullring
We're going to grab the world
By the horns of misfortune
And let's make fun of sadness
Old women, crazy women and tourists are coming in
Excursions are coming in
Benefits and columnists are coming in
Swappers are coming in
Marialvas and choristers are coming in
Cockies with combs are coming in
Knights are coming in with a gallop
Of their heroism
That crazy music is coming in
Called Paso Doble
The fan and the old-fashioned are coming in
The snobbery and the hate too
Moralistic business people are coming in
Frustrations are coming in
Antiquaries and fado singers are coming in
And contradictions
A lot of dollars are coming in, many people
Who pay their millions
And the intelligent man says that songs are over

Junger Tag,"The darkness and its sorrows
Are fleeing from the day, up to the stars
The first light is calling for the morning
And the sun is rising New day, I'm asking you:
What's your gift for me?
Will you bring me back yesterday's tears
Or new love and new happiness?
Turn around and show your face
New day, don't disappoint me! My dreams are flying through time and space
And they're still fighting with the shadows of the night
But there's sunlight coming through the trees
And the Earth is awakening New day, I'm asking you:
What's your gift for me?
Will you bring me back yesterday's tears
Or new love and new happiness?
Turn around and show your face
New day, don't disappoint me! New day, what will the wind carry along
Once a new light comes up?
Will it bring me back yesterday's tears
Or new love and new happiness?

New day, then I'll trust you! New day, then I'll trust you

Un train qui part,"A train that leaves
A train ticket crumpled in a pocket
With, in a hand, a pocketbook
She's only eighteen years old, a big suitcase
Blue eyes looking at a train that arrives
A train that leaves is a bit like a home
A train that leaves
For the one who never knew a home
A train that leaves
A train that leaves is a bit like a song
A train that leaves
For the one who doesn't hear songs being sung
At the departure
The train scours the countryside, taking her to Paris
What could she do there to gain her livelihood?
She doesn't know many things, she's never done anything
Other than leaving those that she loved

A train that leaves

Who is waiting in front of the station

A train that leaves
Where everything ends and starts, like a romance
In a station
A train that leaves is also the train of hope
A train that leaves

Who is waiting in front of the station
A train that leaves is a bit like their song

Chi sarà con te,"Like our first date a year ago
Today I'm waiting for somebody else, and everything will recur
We walk a little and while I take her hand
My heart asks me softly Who will be with you, maybe her hand will caress yours
Who will be, will be, even if it's as exciting as me with her
We don't talk anymore, I come closer and touch her lips
But I think about who will be with you Sparkling shop windows, mirrors for those in love
Cheap cinemas, unknown streets
She, who looks a bit like you, and the fire relights
But a little nostalgia takes me away Who will be with you, who will caress you strongly like me Who will be, will be, what does it matter now, it's as I wanted
My dear love, while I'm thinking of you, who will be with you"
Tu te reconnaîtras,"In childhood dreams
In the student whom the master punished
In the station where
The first adventure of your life begins In those who doubt
In those who believe You'll see, you'll recognize yourself
At every moment in every joy, every tear
You'll see, you'll recognize yourself
In this child, among these people, as you all In the dreams of the artist
Whom glory has never crowned
In this selfish world
Who denies that which he loved In those who fear
In those who are cold You will see, you will recognize yourself
At every moment, in every joy, in every tear
You will see, you will recognize yourself
In this child, among these people, all like you You will see, you will recognize yourself
In this love I have for you
Yes, you will see, you will recognize yourself"
You're Summer (You Never Tell Me No),"Monday morning - the streets are black with rain
Under a skylight hovers sad and grey
Tuesday waits down the endless dreary lane
And every day is like the other day

I am blue and I long for your caress
Oh... your breasts are like swallows a-nestling
You're the summer, life grows in you, summer wind blows in you
Summer rains flow in you, summer sings low in you
You are summer, you never tell me no
Summer, life grows in you, summer wind blows in you
Summer, you never tell me no

Times are stale and the days are long and slow
There is no song can make me laugh and sing
Half past four, I pack up and home I go
Home to the void and fear the evenings bring

I am blue and I long for your caress
Oh... your breasts are like swallows a-nestling
You're the summer, life grows in you, summer wind blows in you
Summer rains flow in you, summer sings low in you
You are summer, you never tell me no
Summer, life grows in you, summer wind blows in you
Summer, you never tell me no

I am blue and I long for your caress
Oh... your breasts are like swallows a-nestling
You're the summer, life grows in you, summer wind blows in you
Summer rains flow in you, summer sings low in you
You are summer, you never tell me no

You are summer, you never tell me no"
De oude muzikant,"Through the streets of Paris
 Still the same tune sounds
 Played by the old musician
 You already hear him across the street Once he was very famous
 His name was mentioned all the time
 Now he’s very old and grey
 Older than the city of Paris Through the streets, over squares
 Sounds that one song
 This melody will never disappear
 Even though you don’t know it Lonely are his days now
 Nobody who knows him anymore He plays his accordion
 And he thinks of how it once began
 Now, life is grubby and grey
 In the streets of Paris His friends don’t know him anymore
 Only now, they look down on him
 He still plays for money on the street
 From early in the morning till late at night Nobody who waits for him anymore
 But sometimes he seems to be laughing again
 He was famous all over the country
 That old grey musician Through the streets, over squares
 Sounds that one song
 This melody will never disappear
 Even though you don’t know it Lonely are his days now
 Nobody who knows him anymore He plays his accordion
 And he thinks of how it once began
 Now, life is grubby and grey
 In the streets of Paris"
Do I Dream,"Does the sun dance on the river?
Does it sparkle? Does it quiver?
Do I dream?

Are the mountains blue and hazy
Or am I a little crazy?
Do I dream?

My darling, tell me, do your arms enfold me?
Did you say you love me only?
Is it true, or am I in a dream?

Has this cloud a silver lining?
Will the sun be always shining?
Darling, do I dream?

Are we walking through the heather?
Are we holding hands together?
Do I dream?

Are there many coloured flowers?
Have we loved away the hours?
Do I dream?

My darling, if I'm dreaming, do not wake me
Never let my dream forsake me
I love you and that is not a dream

Will this love go on forever?
Could we share our life together?
Do I dream? Do I dream? Do I dream?

Is the moon a little brighter?
Are my footsteps feeling lighter?
Do I dream?

Are there lucky stars above me?
Tell me once again you love me
Do I dream?

My darling, are we walking close together?
Could we stay like this forever?
Is it true, or am I in a dream?

Will this love go on forever?
Could we share our life together?
Do I dream? Do I dream? Do I dream?

Are we walking close together?
Could we stay like this forever?
Is it true, or am I in a dream?

Will this love go on forever?
Could we share our life together?
Do I dream? Do I dream? Do I dream?"

Ey sham (אי שם),"The middle of the night has come and I am awake
Dreams come to the threshold
It's the silence before the storm
Let's go now There – there I saw a rainbow
There – there the morning rises in white
Somewhere – there we'll find the garden together
The garden of love There – there I heard an sweet old melody
There – there is a moon every night
There – there we'll find the garden together
The garden of love Tonight my house is wrapped by the winds
Holding it from every side
We fly beyond the clouds
Hand holding hand Tonight a new day is knocking at my heart
And you are drawing nearer with it
Together we'll ask for the azure gardens
We'll come to their gates There – there I saw a rainbow
There – there the morning rises in white
Somewhere – there we'll find the garden together
The garden of love There – there we'll find the garden together
The garden of love"

Say you'll stay and keep me warm

I need you - it's simple to say
I need you, I must be certain
If you go away, you know there's nothing for me

The nights ahead could be warm and free
The morning winds I give you
I won't disappoint you

The First Day of Love,"And today is the first day of living
'Understanding' - the word of the day
So with faith in the things we believe in
There will always be help on the way

We are changing the tide every hour
We are clearing the sky up above
And we know that with our newborn power
Every day is the first day of love

In our song - the final solution
We have used the words on the wall
Awaiting the love revolution
We all know the curtain will fall

Can't you feel the silent ovation?
Don't you know it's only the start?
In tune with your own generation
You are finding love in your heart

And today is the first day of living
'Understanding' - the word of the day
So, with faith in the things we believe in
There will always be help on the way

We are changing the tide every hour
We are clearing the sky up above
And we know that with our newborn power
Every day is the first day of love

Even though we're at the beginning
We are going down the same road
At last we can say we are winning
We have help to carry our load

And today is the first day of living
'Understanding' - the word of the day
So, with faith in the things we believe in
There will always be help on the way

We are changing the tide every hour
We are clearing the sky up above
And we know that with our newborn power
Every day is the first day of love"

Natati la khayay (נתתי לה חיי),"Back in the first days of history
When the world existed only in theory
Tomorrow, yesterday and the day before were all the same
They used to fight over where the sun should be
But one thing was agreed upon
If one is stubborn
There’s no chance, there’s no compensation
That’s what happened
I gave her my life, I went down on my knees
Believe me, everybody
I learnt what for nothing is and I was offended
Since then many bridges have crossed over the water
And they managed to invent noon
They didn’t know yet about the globe and what’s it shaped like
Whether it’s square, round, or however it feels like
But one thing they knew
And this they immediately established
If she refused – there’s no hope
That’s what happened
I gave her my life, I went down on my knees
Believe me, everybody
I learnt what for nothing is and I was offended
Today you’ll find that the subject of every argument
Is what came first – the egg or the apple?
One says that he’s running out of sky
When there’s enough air for a country or two
Maybe we’ll get along after all
She’ll want it, then we’ll get over it
She denied any access
That’s what happened when
I gave her my life, I went down on my knees
Believe me, everybody, I learned what for nothing is
I gave her my life, I went down on my knees
Believe me, everybody, I learned what for nothing is
I gave her my life, I went down on my knees
Believe me, everybody, I learned what for nothing is
I gave her, I gave her
I gave her my life

Moja generacija (Generacija '42) (Моја генерација (Генерација '42)),"Generation '42 (My generation)
Suddenly that deadly night of year forty-two
Seemed like it was going to snow
But war arrived
And a foreign soldier and fear
My mother gave me life to dream of freedom
The first night to hear gun sounds
To cry with my hand on my lips
My generation from year forty-two
Nicely managed those intense days
My generations from year forty-two
Slept and longed for milk at that time
Times are different now and everyone has his own path
The further we are, the more I want
To know where they live, drink, sing, are now
My generation from year forty-two
Is married now and has kids
My generation from year forty-two
Got all serious, because it has to be like that"
Waterloo,"[Verse 1]
My, my - at Waterloo, Napoleon did surrender
Oh, yeah - and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way

[Pre-Chorus]
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself

[Chorus]
Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo

[Verse 2]
My, my - I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger
Oh, yeah - and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight

[Pre-Chorus]
And how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

[Chorus]
Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo

[Pre-Chorus]
So how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

[Outro]
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo
Woo, Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo
Woo, Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you"
Bye Bye I Love You,"I didn't really speak French
When we both got to know each other
From your side, you don't say a word of English
But you guessed in my eyes, and we were happy All dreams are allowed, although I leave you tonight
Your heart changed so quickly that our dreams have ended Bye bye, I love you, love you
It was the most beautiful summer in my life, I love you, darling
My hurt heart, I leave, letting behind me
So much sorrow, so many days, so much love with you All dreams are allowed, I loved you, I trusted you
I waited for the existence of what you promised me
All dreams are allowed, you haven't been loyal
You made me cry for her, you lied to me too many times Bye bye, I love you, love you
It was the most beautiful summer in my life, I love you, darling
My hurt heart, I leave, letting behind me
So much sorrow, so many days, so much love with you Bye bye, I love you, love you
It was the most beautiful summer in my life, I love you, darling
My hurt heart, I leave, letting behind me
So much sorrow, so many days, so much love with you But to share us, be sorry and love you like before
But to share us, be sorry and love each other like before"
Celui qui reste et celui qui s'en va,"At the end of a love affair, the one who stays is the loser
 The one who leaves already knows somebody is waiting
 At the end of a love affair, at the moment of the last glance
 There’s always, always on earth somewhere The one who stays and the one who leaves
 The one who talks and the one who doesn’t dare
 The one who cries, the one who lowers his eyes
 There’s always, always a moment of farewell The one who stays and the one who leaves
 The one who cheats and the one who doesn’t know it
 The one who very soon is to be forgotten
 And the other who will stay alone all his life
 All his life Of course I understand you, things had to happen this way
 You have the power to leave, I don’t have it
 Of course I understand, of course I’m not mad at you
 But lo and behold, ‘we’ already became ‘you and me’ The one who stays and the one who leaves
 The one who talks and the one who doesn’t dare
 The one who cries, the one who lowers his eyes
 There’s always, always a moment of farewell The one who stays and the one who leaves
 The one who cheats and the one who doesn’t know it
 The one who very soon is to be forgotten
 And the other who will stay alone all his life The one who stays and the one who leaves"
Fleur de liberté,"Flower of liberty
Come back to earth, flower of liberty
Come back to earth, our hearts are prisonners
There's a lot to do and a lot to love
Come back to earth, flower of liberty
Is it really a child of the Good Lord
That I saw passing by this morning?
He already looked like a little old man
Who doesn't expect anything of the next day
Was it really a man I was talking to?
He looked at me without seeing me
Although nothing else seperated us
But the gratings of a counter
Come back to earth, flower of liberty
Come back to earth, our hearts are prisonners
There's a lot to do and a lot to love
Come back to earth, flower of liberty
You who were the princess of the wind
Is it good to live here
In this palace of glass and cement
Where the trees are the enemy?
You have your fingers clenched on the future
Without seeing that the present is dead
The hour has come for me to leave again
This evening I'll still be alone
Come back to earth, flower of liberty
Come back to earth, our hearts are prisonners
There's a lot to do and a lot to love
Come back to earth, flower of liberty
Come back to earth, flower of liberty
Come back to the earth, our hearts are prisonners
There's a lot to do and a lot to love
Come back to earth, flower of liberty"
I See a Star,"The days and nights went by, but no one told me
They can be fun too, if you only see
There's such a lot of beauty you can live for
You only need someone to open up your eyes
And you will see things never seen before

I see a star, a brand new star
It's right there, twinklin' in your eyes
I see a face, a happy face
It's like the mirror of my mind

I see a star, a brand new star
It's right there, twinklin' in your eyes
I see a face, a happy face
It's like the mirror of my mind

You opened up my eyes for all the beauty
The beauty we're inhaling every day
It's been there all my life, so it's my duty
I won't lose sight of it, the fire that you lit
Will keep on burning till the end of time

I see a star, a brand new star
It's right there, twinklin' in your eyes
I see a face, a happy face
It's like the mirror of my mind

I see a star, a brand new star
It's right there, twinklin' in your eyes

Happiness now is being shared by two
I just started my life anew

I see a star, a brand new star
It's right there, twinklin' in your eyes
I see a face, a happy face
It's like the mirror of my mind"
Cross Your Heart,"La lala lala… la lala lala…
La lala lala la…
Cross your heart, say: “I love you”
Cross your heart and hope to die
For a very simple reason, and here’s the reason why:
For so many hearts are broken by one little lie
Cross your heart and hope to die
Sticks and stones wouldn’t break my bones
Though it happened again and again
But I came smiling through, don’t ask me how
Playing at games and calling me names
Never worried me then
But it’s a different game we’re playing now
Cross your heart, say: “I love you”
Cross your heart and hope to die
For a very simple reason, and here’s the reason why:
For so many hearts are broken by one little lie
Cross your heart and hope to die
It wasn’t easy to get up, believe me
To get up again and again
Each time they knocked me down, it hurt a lot
Love’s got to show now, there’s nowhere to go now
This is the end of the line
Because I’m giving this all I’ve got
Cross your heart, say: “I love you”
Cross your heart and hope to die
For a very simple reason, and here’s the reason why:
For so many hearts are broken by one little lie
Cross your heart and hope to die
Lalala la lalala… lalala la lala…

Die Sommermelodie,"I wrote to you today that it's over
But now you're here and I'm pleased
I'm not supposed to love you anymore
You're not free and I have to leave
I have to leave I could tell what you're hiding
For your heart went astray as well
And nobody knows what is about to happen This summer melody
Is nothing but reverie1
Both of us are in love
And still it's not meant to be that way for the two of us This summer melody
Reveals that you're not free
And this time of roses will come to an end one day We'll meet again many times and our dream
Is so beutiful, but sadly it isn't true
And this song of love can be heard in this room
We're a couple, mmm... This summer melody
Is nothing but reverie
Both of us are in love
And still it's not meant to be that way for the two of us This summer melody
Reveals that you're not free
And this time of roses will come to an end one day (This summer melody)
This summer melody
(Is nothing but reverie)
Is nothing but reverie
And this time of roses will come to an end one day"
Mein Ruf nach dir,"My longing for the past
And the reminiscence of our happiness
Are playing a double game with me
And I'm bringing back from oblivion
Every moment of time My call for you will be a cry of love
And the wind will play along a nostalgic song
My call for you shall be like a ray of sun
That will make our love flourish again Questions, whether my life will be worthwhile
If it keeps going on like this without you
Days that are nothing more than dreams
My life is an empty room
Reality is nothing but a silhouette to me My call for you will be a cry of love
And the wind will play along a nostalgic song
My call for you shall be like a ray of sun
That will make our love flourish again Oh... my call for you will be a cry of love
And the wind will play along a nostalgic song
My call for you shall be like a ray of sun
That will make our love flourish again That will make our love flourish again"
E depois do adeus,"I wanted to know who I was,
what I’m doing here
Who has abandoned me,
whom I forgot
I asked myself,
I wanted to know about us But the sea
doesn’t bring me
 your voice
In silence, my love,
in sadness at last
I feel you like a flower,
I feel you hurting me
I remember you, leaving is dying
Like loving
 is winning
and losing
You came as a flower
 that I have picked
You gave me your love, I gave you nothing
In your body, my love,
I fell asleep
I’ve died in it a
nd after dying
 I was reborn And after love,
 and after us
Saying goodbye,
staying alone
Your empty place,
 your absence in me
Your peace
that I lost, my sorrow
that I gained
Again you came as a flower
that I picked
And after love,
and after us
Saying goodbye,
staying alone"
Sì,"I walked a little, following his steps
And who knows why I wasn't laughing anymore
The grass leaned upon my dress
It was as if I was saying goodbye
I can't read my thoughts anymore
But then the atmosphere cleared up
And I had to say yes to him Yes, my mind said yes
Out of fear or out of love
I never asked myself about it
Yes, I softly said yes
To feel an emotion
That I've never had before
And when in his face
The whole sky cleared up
Yes, yes I can't remember anymore what happened after that
Maybe I woke up or I fell asleep
And in my dreams, there were wide prairies
And your hands were holding mine
We ran and then, we ran and then
And then the atmosphere cleared up
And I said yes to you once again
Yes Yes, I softly said yes
To feel an emotion
That I've never had before
And when in his face
The whole sky cleared up Yes (I said yes to love)
(And I would say yes to you every night like then)
Yes, yes"

That's What Friends Are For,"When you’re lonely, when you’re blue
When you need someone to talk to, when you need a talkin’ to

Telling it like it should be, makin’ it simple and plain
If that man needs a helpin’ hand, help him in from the rain
Now I know you, know you well
And I know that you’ve been worryin’, it’s not hard for me to tell
But I’m standin’ right beside you, of that you can be sure

Ladies and gentlemen of the whole wide world
If every now and then a single voice was heard
Telling it like it should be, makin’ it simple and plain
If that man needs a helpin’ hand, help him in from the rain
So remember, take your time
Just be sure and let it harmonise, yeah, be sure and let it rhyme
I might call on you to see me through, so open up your door
That’s what friends are for

Ein Lied kann eine Brücke sein,"Look at your life
What's it been like?
Years, they're just going round in circles
You want to change yourself
But nobody breaks the ice, ooh... Then you're talking to people
Who mean nothing to you
Look, they're feeling just the same as you
But there are still roads
Which lead directly to me
Oh baby A song can be a bridge
And each tone is like a stone
Making it strong and stable
You can walk over it
Understand the others A song can be a bridge
Have a little courage and sing along
And if your heart is ready
Come over this bridge
Away from your loneliness Stop playing and learn how to feel
How many people are friends
Learn how to sing, trust just like a child
Oh baby! A song can be a bridge
And each tone is like a stone
Making it strong and stable
You can walk over it
Understand the others A song can be a bridge
Have a little courage and sing along
And if your heart is ready
Come over this bridge
Away from your loneliness (Nananana nananana...)
(Nananana nananana...)
(Nana nana nana...) So come on and get movin'
Walk across the Bridge of...
Come on and get movin'
Walk across the Bridge of...
Come on and get movin'
Walk across the Bridge of Love!"
Toi,"You
I fell asleep, listening to your voice
Forgetting my life in your niche, in your niche
I woke up, I have found your voice back
And I knew how to love, tell me why, tell me why
You are my only love, you're my existence
You have given me love, you have given me the chance
To understand today that I lived for you
To know that my life doesn't exist without you
Since you're going to steal the memories of my childhood
Let me keep them just the time, just the time
To see again my adolescence, running in the forests
And letting the wind singing for you, singing for you
You are my only love, you're my existence
You gave me love, you gave me the chance
To understand today that I lived for you
To know that my life doesn't exist without you"
Touch My Life (With Summer),"You came along and touched my life with summertime
And filled my soul with rays of golden sunshine
You made me feel that somethin' real was waiting to be found
Changing my whole style, teaching me to smile

Every day, every way, let me stay in your summer
Summer, stay with me
Keep me warm, summer wine
Keep me warm, summertime

I feel the warmth of summer deep inside of me
And know the glow of love will show and free me
And when you're gone, I'll carry on with what you left in me
Something that will grow, everyone will know

Every day, every way, let me stay in your summer
Summer, stay with me
Keep me warm, summer wine
Keep me warm, summertime

I hope you'll be returning when next summer comes
Then we'll be three, together in the summer sun"
Mikado,"Mikado
An old man was sitting mutely at the side of the road
In all the noise and traffic
A child just threw a coin at him
He called him back
Then he showed him a game of mikado
A bundle of sticks, multi-coloured and long
He threw them to a small circle
Softly singing
Mikado, mikado, that's how the old game is called
Mikado, mikado, not everyone reaches the goal
You can get everything with some skill
Mikado, mikado, only trust your luck
Mikado, mikado, that's how the old game is called
Mikado, mikado, never show a feeling
When something doesn't concern you, don't touch it
Mikado, mikado, is now played by everyone
The old man said to the child in front of him:
""Look at this, I'm taking a stick away""
""They remain completely unaffected""
""Those other sticks over there""
""This is the rule, and listen to me now""
""What a child can learn from this""
""When you make just one mistake""
""The next will follow""
Mikado, mikado, that's how the old game is called
Mikado, mikado, not everyone reaches the goal
You can get everything with some skill
Mikado, mikado, only trust your luck
Mikado, mikado, that's how the old game is called
Mikado, mikado, never show a feeling
When something doesn't concern you, don't touch it

Dan ljubezni,"Forget the thousand days
And the thousand nights that are gone
If you don't even know that they ever happened Take just one day, that you hid away
And held it in your heart
You will never forget it again It was your day of love
The most beautiful day that never passes
The world lives for a day of love
The day that gives you everything and takes everything away
You can never know When that day will come for you again
Don't lose the hope
Go ahead and fall asleep, and when the morning wakes you
That will be your day of love It was your day of love
The most beautiful day that never passes
The world lives for a day of love
The day that gives you everything and takes everything away
You can never know When that day will come for you again
Don't lose the hope
Go ahead and fall asleep, and when the morning wakes you
That will be your day of love When that day will come for you again
Don't lose the hope
Go ahead and sleep, and when the morning wakes you
That will be your day of love

Singing This Song,"If things shouldn't go right
Your stars are not twinkling so bright
Don't cry, for what's the use
To be counting your blues?
Just say you had a date
And your friend turned out to be late
Cheer up, think it's a boon
Go on, whistle a tune

Nothing will change what had to be done
It just happened to be
Pack your troubles and make fun
You'll enjoy it, you'll see

So do listen to me
Whatever your trouble may be
Join in and come along
With a smile and a song

It's good to understand
That the world is not at its end
Forget what beats you inside
Keep it out of your mind

Nothing will change what had to be done
It just happened to be
Pack your troubles and make fun
You'll enjoy it, you'll see

Sure love not to be hurt
We were born to live on this Earth
So when something goes wrong
Join in singing this song

Sure love not to be hurt
We were born to live on this Earth
So when something goes wrong

Alone in the bustle
Looking at people

That makes one happy, makes one happy, makes one happy That's called being happy
The feeling not to be alone
That's called being happy
To be  you and I The carefree dreaming
Just about you
And that you will come
Dearest, very soon
To meet you again

And writes my day with its rays

You and me, yes, ah ah ah…
Like thunder and lightning until the edges of the sea
You and me
You and me, yes
It sounds stronger than the world
Day and night, we both spin tirelessly
Coming from one another and returning to one another
Like the colours of the rainbow we’ll tie a cloud to a string
And we’ll tell him, listen, good days are ahead
You and me, ah ah ah…
You and me, yes, ah ah ah…
Like thunder and lightning until the edges of the sea

Seninle bir dakika,"A minute with you makes me happy
One minute darling, to forget these lost years Desire is endless, seeing each other only lasts one minute
Love lasts a whole life, making love only a minute We met each other, only one minute
Darling, my eyes were drinking from your eyes for one minute Desire is endless, seeing each other only lasts one minute
Love lasts a whole life, making love only a minute"
Une chanson c'est une lettre,"You see? – The song is a letter
That you write for yourself and then throw away
It never sees the mailbox
However You have the courage to say in it: ""I love you""
Because it's someone else on the stage
Who comes and shout it without fearing
The spotlights A song is a letter
That you write in your head
A song is a letter
That you never...
That you never mail Love is always perfect in it
You're never afraid to feel silly
When your heart is ready to surrender
To another heart It's easier to say: ""I love you""
In an alexandrine of your poem
Love on stage doesn't match love
In real life A song is a letter
That you write in your head
A song is a letter
That the postman will never ever take along ""Let's both leave on that ship""
That's something I can't say
My throat squeezes and gets stuck
At the idea
That one day I'd have to write you
Those words planted there on the other shore
It's a mistake to write you a letter
So I sang A song is a letter
That you write in your head
A song is a letter
That the postman will never take along A song is a letter
That you write in your head
A song is a letter
That stays inside of you
That crumples and dies"
Old Man Fiddle,"The door opens wide - every head turns round to stare
He steps inside with raindrops on his hair
A grey old man with legs a-limping, he finds himself a chair
Then he lifts a fiddle and bow with gentle care

And just like sunlight out of the rain, old man fiddle's come to play again
And light this night up into flame
Just his dancing fiddling bow brings to life all sleepy toes
In this old heart till morning glows

So kiss the blues goodbye
Let the mountain melody brighten the night and make the good times fly
Feet are dancing free in ragtime reverie
Pick up your lazy legs and give it a try

We sang along into the dawn till our cares were just memories
Danced in time to country tunes
In some valley he lives free, where his notes ripen on the trees
Underneath the harvest moon

So kiss the blues goodbye
Let the mountain melody brighten the night and make the good times fly
Feet are dancing free in ragtime reverie
Pick up your lazy legs and give it a try

In the gentle falling rain, you could still hear the loving sound
That filled the night with memories
And when the skies are turning grey, bring him back here to play again
He'll waken blossoms on the trees

So kiss the blues goodbye
Let the mountain melody brighten the night and make the good times fly
Feet are dancing free in ragtime reverie
Pick up your lazy legs and give it a try"
Madrugada,"Dawn
From those who died without knowing why
From those who persevered in silence and in cold
From the strength born in fear
And rage liberated in the early morning
The banks of my river are made
From the scars of my old ground
And from the memory of my blood burning in fire
From the darkness opening in colour
Arm in arm and a flower in each gun
The edges of my people are made
I'm singing about the people that have just discovered themselves
And raise their voices, celebrate
I'm singing the praises of the land that is reborn
There can't be enough songs like this
In each vein the blood is waiting its turn
In each conversation we hunt the day
This is how we learn about the tides
This is how we grow and become men
A new song is born
Awaken lights on the evening-blind door posts
Raise your voices and celebrate
Sing wide awake in the morning
That the night delivered us
There can't be enough songs like this
Sing about the tides in those sargasso beaches
Raise your voices, celebrate
Run, barefooted, by the wharf
Open your arms and hug
There can't be enough songs like this
There can't be enough songs like this"
Tú volverás,"You will return to be the simple girl
Who took the train of life
Before being a woman You will return, get down in motion if you can
And though years won't return
You will return... you will return
Take your life and your bag You will return, though dresssed in forgetfulness
Even for the fried who taught you to kiss You will return, the road is always shorter
And though you return from emptiness
You will return... you will return
Take your life and your bag
Come back now I know you left the olive trees
Your family and friends, for succeed
But don't mind if somebody thinks
That you played and lost, come back now You will return, now that the train stops
That snowed in your forehead
You will return... you will return
Take your life and your bag
Come back now You will return... you will return
Take your life and your bag
You will return"
"Jennie, Jennie","I know that tonight you're alone
In your room with a note in your hand
In your dreams you're regretting

I know that you're crying
But there's no denying
That time has a different melody

Era,"For a few weeks now
I've already felt like another woman
That everything was going to pot
Now, now, now There I am, next to you
Lover, I'm all yours
And it almost feels like a century
When making love It was kissing at the cinema
It was my Sunday
It was finding a hidden corner
It was, it was It was blushing in public (Love)
It was speaking in code (About love)
It was going back home before the evening
It was The stories that I made up for my folks
The friends I never even knew
The letters hidden in the laundry
It was now, now Now I'm facing the world
When a love is mine, mine
And it almost feels like a century
When making love It was kissing at the cinema
It was my Sunday
It was finding a hidden corner
It was, it was It was blushing in public (Love)
It was speaking in code (About love)

Save Your Kisses for Me,"[Verse 1]
Though it hurts to go away, it's impossible to stay
But there's one thing I must say before I go
I love you (I love you), you know
I'll be thinking of you in most everything I do
Now the time is moving on and I really should be gone
But you keep me hanging on for one more smile
I love you (I love you), all the while
With your cute little way will you promise that you'll save

[Chorus]
Your kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Gonna walk out the door
But I'll soon be back for more
Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
So long, honey, so long
Hang on, baby, hang on
Don't you dare me to stay
'Cause you know I'll have to say

[Verse 2]
That I've got to work each day and that's why I go away
But I count the seconds 'til I'm home with you
I love you (I love you), it's true
You're so cute, honey gee, won't you save them up for me

[Chorus]
Your kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Gonna walk out the door
But I'll soon be back for more
Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
So long, honey, so long
Hang on, baby, hang on
Don't you dare me to stay
'Cause you know you've got to save
Your kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Won't you save them for me even though you're only three"
"Djambo, Djambo","Die Vögel kennen ihn seit vielen Jahren

Den alten Mann
Der täglich Futter bringt
Die Hände wie ein Bär und doch so zärtlich

Als wären sie von einem kleinen Kind
Als Clown war er der Liebling der Manege

Der Zirkus seine Welt und sein Zuhaus
Man nannte ihn den großen Djambo Djambo

Und oft hört er im Traum noch den Applaus

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Djambo Djambo

Sei nicht traurig
Denn die Show

Die große Show
Muß weiter geh'n
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Djambo Djambo

Auch wenn and're jetzt für dich im Zirkus steh'n

Die Kinder schau'n ihn an mit großen Augen

Sie steh'n um ihn herum und alles schweigt

Wenn Djambo Djambo ihnen auf der Straße
Noch einmal ein kleines Kunststück zeigt
Dann lacht er wie in seinen besten Tagen
Als gingen wieder alle Lichter an
Als spielte die Musik genau wie damals

Wenn Nacht für Nacht die große Show begann

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

Chansons pour ceux qui s'aiment,"So many melodies mark our way
And without them the world be worse off today Modern or old-fashioned, they all make us dream
Und each one of us keeps them hidden in our hearts Songs for those who love each other
Old songs with everlasting words
Songs that remember and that come back when love is gone Songs for those who love each other
New songs with words of lovers
Songs that are always faithful and remind us of happy days We can redo everything, change the world
Live without borders, we'll sing
Forget history, believe, not believe anymore
Things will stay the same in our memories Songs for those who love each other
Songs that remember and that people wait for
One day, sing the same one and it'll turn into
The anthem of peace from now on, from now on"
Judy et Cie,"Judy, Judy isn’t beautiful
Judy, Judy, the one who is forgotten (She is forgotten)
From the moment the evening ends
Judy, Judy, you are needled
Judy, Judy, you are married (You are married)
But always with a dream
Underneath your mascara and jewels
You pray to Saint Marilyn Monroe
To be a doll, a darling toy
Burning with enthusiasm
Finally the woman
Judy, Judy escapes
Judy, Judy, in magic (In magic)
Bottles that are so soft to believe
Judy, life is a ridiculous dream
A day, an evening changing of skin
With the girls on photo
To have a body, thin as reed
And eyes totally empty, but no wrinkles
Judy, Judy and company
Judy, Judy, she is sacrificed (She is sacrificed)
Against a handful of snow
Poor Judy
"
When,"When the days of wine are gone
And all the nights are long
Then all my thoughts run on to you
When the lonely silence calls
When I walk through empty halls
Then all my thoughts run on to you
And when they linger for a while
You come and touch me with your tender smile
And when your love was all my world
My days, my life – you were
Then all the songs were songs of you
I tasted well of sweet success
Nothing touched me that was second best
Oh, but then I turned and you were gone
To someone else’s song
And now I’m going back to when
I loved you now and then
When the story now is told
And all my love unfolds
I’ve lost my very soul to you
Your love was written in the sky
But at the time, I never looked so high
Darlin’, when will you come back to me?
Release me, set me free
When? Oh, when?"
The Party's Over,"The lights are low
The party's goin' on
And he who's mine
He doesn't seem to miss me
I feel alone
I think that I'll go home
But if I stay, at least I hear him

The party's over now
The party's over now
At least I dream it's over now
He's sittin' next to me
And we do both agree
Our life ain't bad at all

Yes, the party's over now
One of those bad dreams
Suddenly came over me
But now I feel at ease

The lights go out
The party's goin' on
And he who's mine
Seems really to enjoy it
I hear him whisper sweet words
But not to me
I wonder, am I really dreamin'?

The party's over now
The party's over now
At least I dream it's over now
He's sittin' next to me
And we do both agree
Our life ain't bad at all

Suddenly came over me
But now I feel at ease

Yes, the party's over now

Mata Hari,"There are days I just can’t make it
Even though I try to fake it
When I wish that I could take it
Turn a page and start anew
In a world with no tomorrow
I could throw away my sorrow
And pretend you’d let me borrow
All the magic and wonder of you
And for a while feel alive
Mata Hari, any man would pay the price of sweet surrender
Mata Hari, for the promise in your eyes – it was so tender
Those you conquered with your dance never did have a chance
You walked away laughing and left them alone with their shame
As our dreams are slowly dying
We find no escape in lying
Why should we go on denying
Life is never what it seems?
But in times when I am lonely
I keep thinking of you only
Even though you’d never known me
Can’t you visit me once in my life
And let me feel you were real?
Mata Hari, any man would pay the price of sweet surrender
Mata Hari, for the promise in your eyes – it was so tender
Those you conquered with your dance – they never did have a chance
You walked away laughing and left them alone with their shame
Mata Hari, any man would pay the price of sweet surrender
Mata Hari, for the promise in your eyes – it was so tender
All the secrets sealed with their lips, they gave away for a kiss
The eye of the morning and star of the night was your name"
"Panagia mou, Panagia mou (Παναγιά μου, Παναγιά μου)","Fields full of oranges, oh-oh my Mother

 It’s not a camping place for tourists, oh-oh my Mother
 They’re only, only refugees My Lady, my Lady, Soothe my heart
My Lady, my Lady, Soothe my heart And if you see shattered ruins, oh-oh my Mother
 It’s not from other, from other eras
 It is burnt by napalm, oh-oh my Mother
 Since yesterday, there are countless crumbled rocks
And if you see newly dug land, oh-oh my Mother
 They’re not fertile fields, fields
 There will be crosses planted on them, oh-oh my Mother
 Which will decompose, decompose through time My Lady, my Lady, Soothe my heart

Pump-Pump,"I used to love watching beautiful girls go by in my time

I used to worry so much about all kinds of little things
Now it is easy to laugh and to dance when it really swings
Now we’re together forever, I know
Playing the games that two people only play when they’re in love
Let your hip go hippety pump pump
That’s the way we dance till we die.. ay ay ay…
Let your hip go hippety pump pump
Give me shivers all down my spine… ay ay ay…

Sobran las palabras,"Sometimes, words are unnecessary
When it's about talking
Simply of love
And I prefer the eloquence of a silence
To that weary phrase
That sounds like nothing in my voice. I know that you can believe
That I lack the interest
But sometimes the most fervent promises
Only try to hide that love is dying. Love, love, my love
You'd have to accept me this way
If you see that I don't like to talk
Learn to understand my absence. Love, love, my love
It's all I can say
To love is something more than making laugh
I know I'll fill your life with love."
We'll Live It All Again (Io rivivrei),"I remember your face
When the first time we kissed
How you started to blush
What you said when you touched my hand

And the drives to the beach
With the sand on my feet
What we drew on the shore
It's as it were yesterday

Mi ricordo quei giorni
Fino all'alba l'amore
Le tue bambole antiche
Sorridevano insieme a te

E i tuoi corti vestiti
Come prati fioriti
Che distesi nel vento
Mi ridavano la libertà

I'd live it all again
Anch'io lo rivivrei
Anch'io lo rivivrei
We'll live it all again

When we had our first babe
How we found her new games
How she smiled when she saw me
And the first time she called you dad

All the good times we had
Although some of them were bad
Through the laughter and pain
But the feeling was always there

Mi ricordo quei anni
Quante giuste canzoni
Quante maschere in giro
E tu sola vicino a me

Solitudine in due
E cent'anni son pochi
Se vivessi di nuovo
Io te sempre risceglierei

I'd live it all again
Anch'io lo rivivrei
Anch'io lo rivivrei
We'll live it all again

Uma flor de verde pinho,"I could call you my homeland
Give you the most beautiful Portuguese name
I could give you a queen's name
As this love is from Pedro towards Inês. But there is no shape, no verse,
No bed for this fire, my love, for this river
A heart outside its chest, so to speak
My love overflowed. And I have no ship. Loving you is a poem that I do not recite
As there is no glass, my love, for this wine
No guitar nor singing friend
There is no flower, no green-pine flower There is no boat nor wheat nor clover.
There are no words to write this song.
Loving you is a poem that I do not write.
As there is a river without bed. And I have no heart. But there is no shape, no verse,
No bed for this fire, my love, for this river
A heart outside its chest, so to speak
My love overflowed. And I have no ship."

You say hello and you know it’s love
It’s nice to be in love again
That old familiar feeling when
You meet your girl and the world stands still
Your heart is filled with sweet melody
It’s nice to be in love again
The sweetest thrill, I couldn’t believe it
I hadn’t even a friend
This heart of mine was thinking of leaving
Until you came walking round that bend
It’s nice to be in love again
That old familiar feeling when you say hello
And you know it’s love
It’s nice to be in love again
That old familiar feeling when
You meet your girl and the world stands still
Your heart is filled with sweet melody

You meet your girl and the world stands still

Ran away far from her children's games
Was she right to leave her home
To stand in front of you today? I'm not an idol who is loved and destroyed
I always live my roaring twenties far from Paris
And without having a Rolls, I believe there's no better
When I see some kids playing around me A little Frenchwoman born in Provence
When she was fifteen, she came to Paris
she married singing, didn't change her name
And there she is, in front of you today A little Frenchwoman born in Provence
Ran away far from her children's games
Was she right to leave her home
to stand in front of you today?"
De mallemolen,"In the merry-go-round of life
You all ride your own turn
The whirligig turns also without you
Your horse is never empty for a long time
So come on, ride on the merry-go-round At the merry-go-round of life
Everyone is waiting in a queue
Waiting till you can join in
It might take a while
But there's a horse for everyone In the merry-go-round of life
You all ride your own turn
The whirligig turns also without you
Your horse is never empty for a long time
So come on, ride on the merry-go-round Once you're in the whirligig of life
At first you might be a little scared
Then someone will hold you
Till you can do it on your own
Because the merry-go-round fear never lasts too long In the merry-go-round of life
You all ride your own turn
The whirligig runs also without you
Your horse is never free for a long time
So come on, all ride on the merry-go-round And that merry-go-round of human lives
Goes on till you're dizzy
But you still hold tight
Although you don't like it anymore
Because what's next to the whirligig is too unknown In the merry-go-round of life
You all ride your own turn
The whirligig runs also without you
Your horse is never free for a long time
So come on, all ride on the merry-go-round In the merry-go-round of life
You all ride your own turn
The whirligig runs also without you
Your horse is never free for a long time
So come on, all ride on the merry-go-round So come on, all ride on the merry-go-round

Brother John, Brother John
Wake up, wake up
There is so much better to do
Than playing my big brother
I'm not a child anymore, you know
My little body has grown
And I enrage to be a good girl
When your friends want to kiss me
Peter - I'm scared, Harry - I laugh
Pablo, Tino, Pedro - zero
Simon - oh no, William - what a drama
I shout, I bite and you sleep
Harold passes very close to me, and Pierre tightens me
Eric, Patrick - it's the panic
Brother John, save me
(Brother John) In my dreams
(Brother John) You take me with you
(Are you sleeping?) In my night
(Are you sleeping?) You flee me
Without you, I'd become a nun

I've put some red on my lips
And perfume on my fever
But most of all, don't sleep too long

Portugal no coração,"Portugal was the reason
Why one day my brother died
But it's also a heart
To beat in this song
I don't know of whom I was born
I didn't find out who my father and mother are
I just know I was born here and it was here
Where I was a human being Portugal was the reason
Why one day my brother died
But it's also a heart
To beat in this song I say everything about myself
Am I a child or a daisy?
I hardly have what I give:
A place nobody wants At this country where I am
I'll do everything I want
This homeland to which I gave myself
Isn't male or female Portugal wants to give a hand to everybody
And to be friends, to have bread
Portugal will have the aim
To end with longings Portugal is already old enough
For its people to understand freedom
Portugal is the nation
Where my brothers live Portugal, oh my love
The heart in my song
Beat, beat heart
To have a better life Portugal, oh my love
The heart in my song
Beat, beat heart
To have a better life Portugal, oh my love
The heart in my song
Beat, beat heart
To have a better life"

Ahava hi shir lishnayim (אהבה היא שיר לשניים),"In the middle of the night I heard a voice,
it was my brother's voice on the rivers of Babylon
a mute prayer not consoled
to the Land of Israel. From the silence his voice went up
there wasn't a storm in it, nor fire
just a 'balalaika' in my blood tonight
and the voice of a ma whispering: Balalaika, balalaika,
oh, sing to me if I forget thee Jerusalem,
Balalaika, balalaika,
my song will yet be heard in the Land of Israel
Balalaika, balalaika,
my song will yet be heard in the Land of Israel In the middle of the night I whispered to him:
I heard your prayer from the weeping,
I hear, I know
my brother, you are my brother. In the middle of the night he is still playing,
but in the morning his voice will go silent,
I will then take it and carry it
to the whole wide world. Balalaika, balalaika..."
Swiss Lady,"Swiss lady
She was rather slim, she was slim like a twig
And sometimes he took her out of his closet
There he played music and put his hand tenderly around her
He played rock 'n' roll, he played Dixieland
And was known as the One-Man-Mountain-Band
He said: ""only thanks to her is the world full of music""
""She gives me everything and doesn't forget me""
She's my Swiss lady
And I - a man from the mountains
And who has ever heard her
Will understand me for sure

When he came home, he took her by the arm
Where he lovingly put her to pieces
But before that, he played one time in Dixie style again
And in the deep of the night, when the people have woken up
And complained, then he just laughed
He said: ""I'm inviting you and let's celebrate""
""Because my lady doesn't want to sleep yet""

Enséñame a cantar,"When I went out of home,
to go for a walk,
Thinking of my problems,
Wanting to forget,
I came upon a girl,
Sitting on the hallway
Playing with a banjo,
Singing restlessly. Teach me to sing,
Teach me to sing
Because my heart is sad
And I need to love I looked at her smiling
And without knowing why
Her face got brighter
And smiled too
Sit by my side,
If you want to learn,
Don't be ashamed,
I'm gonna teach you"

L'oiseau et l'enfant,"Like a child with light in the eyes
Who sees birds flying away
Like the blue bird flying over the earth
See how the world, the world is beautiful. Beautiful the boat with dance on vogues
Drunk of life, of love and of wind
Beautiful the song of emerging vogues
Deserted with white sand White the innocent, the blood of the poet
Who invent the love while singing
So that the life dress up party
And that the night turns into day Day of a life where the dawn is rising
To wake up the city with heavy eyes
Where mornings flakes the dreams
To give us a world of love Love is you, love is me
The bird is you, the child is me. I am just a girl of shade
Who sees shine the evening star
You my star who weaves my round
Come turn on my black sun Black the misery, the humans and the war
Who believe that they hold the reins of time
Country of love do not have borders
For those who have a child heart Like a childwith light in the eyes
Who sees birds flying away
Like the blue bird flying over the earth
See how the world, how the world is beautiful Love is you, love is me
The bird is you, the child is me
The bird is you, the child is me."
Born to Sing,"I said: ""It would never work""
You said: ""Let us try""
I said: ""I'm a travelling man who will only make you cry""
And when the feeling hit me and I had to move along
You said: ""You were right, I guess, you must sing your song""

And a man is born to do one thing and I was born to sing
And I must take the good times and the bad times that it brings
And I missed you in the morning, but most of all at night
And I couldn't stop the music, though I tried with all my might

I lie in bed and watch the shadows moving on the wall
And the loneliness is killing me, so I turn the radio on
And I need you now, I want you, in the slow morning light
And the music makes it easier, but it doesn't make it right

And a man is born to do one thing and I was born to sing
And I must take the good times and the bad times that it brings
And I missed you in the morning but most of all at night
And I couldn't stop the music, though I tried with all my might

Some day, I hope, you will understand why I live this way
Songs keep moving in my head, this music I must play
So I pack my bags and once again I get out on the road
Another day, maybe tonight, I might catch my soul

And a man is born to do one thing and I was born to sing
And I must take the good times and the bad times that it brings
And I missed you in the morning, oh, but most of all at night
And I couldn't stop the music, though I tried with all my might

And a man is born to do one thing and I was born to sing
And I must take the good times and the bad times that it brings
And I missed you in the morning, oh, but most of all at night
And I couldn't stop the music

Questo amore,"This love – you're to die for
This love – come on, let's stop dancing
This love – it's warm in here, let's go outside for a while This love – I'm not working tomorrow
Me neither – your mouth on mine
How hard it is to go away, that's how it started
Like this, with nothing The turning fun ride, and my head is spinning me around
Say it right and don't be afraid, no
I bet you really want me
Let's walk together, a little longer, a little higher This love – you're to die for
Don't speak, I can't breathe
This love – lively water upon me
It's true, I really want you This love – your nails, my arms
Your face, your mouth on mine
How hard it is to go away, but why would I go away? This love – so many improvised games
Two children would never be
Closer, more impossible than us"

Your little feet walk with unsteady steps
But time goes by and a little boy grows into a man

Because it's easier to go your own way
Sometimes it's difficult to understand the hard world
Remember this, and a new time will begin Sometimes it's difficult to understand the hard world
Remember this, and a new time will begin The little hand is still in my hand for a while
The sunniest smile answers to mother's smile
Then I hope that I could stop the time
Soon I'll notice you've become a man Often in your journey to the adults' hard world
You'll have to take a stand on many ideas and skin colours
But it's most important to give love a chance
Often in your journey to the adults' hard world Remember this and a new time will begin

I just hope that one day you come back to me

Do you wanna dance a waltz

The Bad Old Days,"Remember me?
I was tossed and turnin' like a ship without a sea
I was lost for learnin' like a song without a key
Remember when
I was all alone without a soul to call my friend?
Who'd have thought those days would ever end?

Those were the bad old days
Before I had your love to guide me
Sad old days
You set me free from all those bad old days
You put all the good inside of me

Those were the bad old days
(Those were the sad old days)
Before I had you there besides me
Sad old days
And can't you see? - you took the bad old days
And you put all the good inside of me

Remember who
Walked into my life and put their foot inside my shoe
Now what was just a place for one is home for two
Remember why
I'm gonna stay with you until the day I die
We can watch the good old days go by

Those were the bad old days
Before I had your love to guide me
Sad old days
You set me free from all those bad old days
You put all the good inside of me

Oh dooby-doo...
Dooby-dooby-dooby-doo...
Ah...

Those were the bad old days
(Those were the sad old days)
Before I had you there beside me
Sad old days
(Those were the sad old days)
And can't you see you took the bad old days
And you put all the good inside of me?

(Those were the bad old days)
(Those were the bad old days)
You put all the good inside of me
(Those were the bad old days)
Ah...
(Those were the bad old days)
You put all the good inside of me"
Vivre,"Why not believe in the beautiful story
That makes the heart and the seasons sing?
I want to forget everything in your arms
And to restart everything with you
To share colors and songs
Why not follow this beautiful story?
Why not smile at the new day?
We will slip away, my love
And we'll find again the song
That we will finally live in unison To live, we will live a thousand happinesses
To go through the hours like free birds
To live, I want to live it, this musical dream
To gather the stars of love Why not believe in the beautiful story
That makes the heart and the spring sing?
My life started with you
The sun is risen in joy
You've made me find my childlike heart again To live, I want to live it, this musical dream
To gather the stars of love
To live, I want to live it, this musical dream
To gather the stars of love"
L'amour ça fait chanter la vie,"Love puts coloured pencils in your heart
 So you can draw the world
 Love, you become a musician
 For a blonde, even a real little Chopin Love is so fantastic
 It puts happiness in music
 It laughs about the whole symphony
 Love makes life change Love puts a fabulous look in your eyes
 So that your whole face changes
 Love gives you wings
 So you can climb heaven onto the seventh floor Love is so fantastic
 It puts happiness in music
 It laughs about the whole symphony
 Love makes life change Love is a great magician
 That can change your sorrow in less than a second
 Love, to cut a long story short
 It gives you youth in all corners of the world Love is so fantastic
 It puts happiness in music
 It laughs about the whole symphony
 Love makes you sing about life Life"
't Is OK,"I'm breaking down; gonna start from scratch
Shake it off like an Etch-A-Sketch
My lips say goodbye
There are no tears in my eyes I'm not the way that I used to be
I took the record off repeat
With you I was dormant
But today I rise full of life I won't fall again, no
I won't fall again, no
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me
Miss Movin’ On I broke the glass that surrounded me (around me)
I ain't the way you remember me (I'm not like that)
I was such a good girl
I was frail but not anymore I jumped the fence to the other side (but I'm ok)
My whole world was electrified
Now I'm no longer afraid
It's Independence Day I won't fall again, no
I won't fall again, no
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me
Miss Movin’ On Everything is changing and
I never wanna go back to the way it was
I'm finding who I am and
who I am from here on out is gonna be enough
It's gonna be enough I'll never be that girl again, no
I won't fall again, oh
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me

I'm movin' on"
Sevince,"The hands of time brushed us
Everything changed a long time ago
We are not the same, the two of us
To your weaknesses, I gave one night
To your mistakes, a lotus flower
To your lovelessness, a heart Now give it back
You can't give back all that you've taken
Now give it back
No fault is being given back
Entrust to my nonexistence
The things remaining from me in you
Take everything
Give me me back
If only my luck
Some other place, some other time
Let me be without you until I die"
Feuer,"I will never let myself be trained by the men
That's what I've sworn
Whatever they say, it doesn't turn me on
I let them wait
But once somebody came along telling me:
""Do you want to live as a touch-me-not?""
""Do you never think about that?"" Fire (Fire)
Doesn't just burn in the fireplace
Fire (Fire)
Also burns inside of me
And it's getting hotter and hotter through your love Fire (Fire)
That no one can escape from
Fire (Fire)
Gives meaning to life
Don't run away when you feel it's here
You're in no danger at all When I will burn my fingers today
I won't be sorry about it at all
Is fire dangerous?
I will think about it, once, when it suits me
I want to experience it today, it's strange
Tomorrow I won't be the same
And that's what you make clear to me Fire (Fire)
Doesn't just burn in the fireplace
Fire (Fire)
Also burns inside of me
And it's getting hotter and hotter through your love Fire (Fire)
That no one can escape from
Fire (Fire)
Gives meaning to life
Don't run away when you feel it's here
You're in no danger at all Fire (Fire)
That no one can run away from

Gives sense to your life
Don't run away when you feel it's here
You're in no danger at all

Boom boom,"What is wrong with me, I feel a little ill?
I think it's problems or too much smoke
No, I don't smoke and I don't drink at all
Then maybe it's your fitness that's worse than you think No, I went to the doctor, and guess what he said?
That you should stop with the goods of life from today
I'd lay down on the couch and he examined me
What happened? What did he say? What's the matter with you? It's all natural, the heart pounds
When you are in love with a girl
If you feel giant beats you tend to get nervous
It's love that knocks inside And it goes boom boom and boom boom with lust
It feels like thunder here in my chest
Yes, it goes boom boom and beats obsessively
It pounds and it beats day and night Now I understand why you look so pale
I'm glad, but tell me, what do you think is on the way?
It's the big love, I know it from myself
So you felt like I do, do tell, do tell, do tell It's all natural, the heart pounds
When you are in love with a girl
If you feel giant beats you tend to get nervous
It's love that knocks inside And it goes boom boom and boom boom with lust
It feels like thunder here in my chest
Yes, it goes boom boom and beats obsessively
It pounds and it beats day and night Yes, it goes boom boom and boom boom with lust
It feels like thunder here in my chest

Ooh, he comes to me like a bandit, asking: Do you speak French?
The language of love and summer
That's an opportunity for a French course
Shame on him who thinks ill of it He says to me:
Do you speak French?
But tonight, let me invite you
To see the lights in a nice way
To make love in good French What happiness, without clouds
The true love
When you cry
Of happiness?
To embrace
Delighted

Next year, more than a week
We'll go there together
We'll be...

When we were children
We would love in secret
Who were we nice to?
Only to uncles and aunts
And the poor girls suffered
Those sweethearts, they’d just get beaten up
And what we really felt
We whispered only in the Bet language
I love
I love you
I love
I love you
Love is a beautiful word
It’s a wondrous prayer, it’s a language
Love is good to me
It will always overcome
And we shall speak in a language of love
I love
I love you
I love
I love you
I dream and I wake up to three words
And what is the world? Three words
And that is how I feel now
Just like back then, in the Bet language

Det blir alltid värre framåt natten,"By day and in the evenings I am alive
I like job, have pals to talk to, everything's going nicely
I go out and have a beer and listen to a band
I dance and enjoy the warmth of some girl Towards the night, it always gets worse
Far away from all the lights, all the laughter
I lie awake thinking of you
Remember too much and am alone I always come up with something, do what I want
Have nothing to be considerate of and no time to lose
Go to the cinema, play squash whenever I want to
And dine out late and expensively and well, have a good time in the evenings Towards the night, it always gets worse
Far away from all the lights, all the laughter
I lie awake thinking of you
Remember too much and am alone Towards the night, it always gets worse
Far away from all the lights, all the laughter
I lie awake thinking of you
Remember too much and am alone Towards the night, it always gets worse
Far away from all the lights, all the laughter

Raggio di luna,"If I sometimes look like a liar to you, you don't know
There's an honest world that never lies When a moonbeam
Notices me through the sky and the stars
And a breeze
Makes time lose its haste When a moonbeam
Wipes away every shadow of doubt and deceit
I'm more free and true, I fly towards you, wholehearted You're mistaken if you don't believe in yourself
If I sometimes – it's normal – see only myself But there's a moonbeam
That I'm impatiently waiting for every night because
It'll take me back to a time
That is raised for the love that only belongs to you When a moonbeam
Can give the thought the biggest wings that it's got
I'm more free and true, I fly towards you, wholehearted A moonbeam is enough
To turn the sea into jazz music
And to stay alone both at home and outside
But it's always you and I When a moonbeam
Ad-libs a different note for us every time
That it'll be our song, night after night
That it'll be our song, night after night"
Disco tango,"Disco tango
She's a star on a dance floor
Beats John Travolta in a rock 'n' roll
At the disco she's scoring, and there you see
Them queue up with an eye on her, every time she enters
In the daytime she's living a dog's life
Practising dressage as a pastime
But when darkness falls, she's the one opting out
She demands action, it's the same every single day
What can it be that she wants?
Disco tango à la carte
And lots of decorations, flight and speed
A jockey without a horse, who dishes up
With news from USA, soul, reggae or pop
Bach is just as cool in the daytime
Beethoven still takes his slice of the cake
But the night menu is a bit bizarre:
A disco tango à la carte

What we are Child of the earth always seeks
Trying to cover his missing

Are taken by evening, in the night they stay Child of the earth always seeks
Some comfort to the arriving eve
The star of the night, your wonderful light
Makes a cloak for the lost one from your shine I watch in the blue sky you, the brightest star

Je suis l'enfant soleil,"He arrived from the north, and I was a Sun Child
He said words stronger and sweeter than heaven's cotton
He shared the bread and my father gave him a bed
""You will start tomorrow, near the gray oak"" I didn't dream of him, I didn't sleep
Stretching my legs at the gray oak, I watched his steps
And all the burning winter, our love made the earth sing
Like a recommencement, like a prayer He was a man of the snow and me, I was a child of the sun
The spring laid its rainbows for us
If he had wanted to leave, I wouldn't have known how to cry
I would keep the smile that he gave to me When the men came, I didn't understand
Before me, he ran towards the gray oak
But without anything he could do, the trap caught him
They thanked my father, then they left He returned to the north, and I was a Sun Child
He had his hands out and the heaven's cotton on his back
He shared the bread, and my father gave him a bed
That day seems far away from me, near the gray oak Eh! Come back, I am the Sun Child

J'ai déjà vu ça dans tes yeux,"A big ship drifting away
Towards the horizon of a blue sky
Rivers flowing through the mountains
I've already seen it in your eyes Skies that are blue or grey
We, hand in hand, silent
Both of us naked at a beach
I've already seen it in your eyes In your eyes I can see
The reflexion of my whole life
My life passing by
Irresistably towards an eternal happiness Oh, for how many winters will I have to believe
That you would go away the next day?
But wait a little for my victory
And I'll promise you a summer A very small place somewhere on Earth
Two or three children in the middle
We, sitting on a bank of stone
I've already seen it in your eyes A very small place somewhere on Earth
Under a big piece of blue sky
We, sitting on a bank of stone
And we'll get old together Together, together
Together, if you want to"
Colorado,"Oh whoa… Colorado
Fly away with me to Colorado

Into a life full of adventures? There are plenty of fish in the rivers
And there is a bear in the photograph
Colorado, Colorado Oh whoa… Colorado

You've been standing at the horizon
You've been watching the sea wondering if earth is round
But all you saw was a boat disappearing
In the rolling mist
I'm not afraid of flying
Because above the clouds heaven's door is ajar
Like earth and moon, we're attracted to each other
Please hold me as tight as you can
I feel like a...

Satellite, satellite, oh... like a satellite, now I understand
Oh... how small the world is

And the sun has warmed us, but when it sets

Mary Ann,"Out on a late night
Way after midnight
Armed with a bottle or two
What's the time?
I'm gettin' out of my mind
I've gotta get to you

She was in black lace
Come back to my place
Come for a drink and a dance
Boy, I found she didn't hang around
I didn't stand a chance

She paid a big rent
For an apartment uptown One-twenty-one
She said: come inside
I've got nothin' to hide
I only want some fun

Havin' a good time
Walkin' a tight line
I was out of my head
Just when I reached for you
Like I usually do
I found her instead

Mary Ann, I'm gonna do what I can
But I can't do more than try
Tearin' my heart out tryin' to make it up to you
Mary Ann, I'm gonna do what I can
That's truth, and that's no lie
Cryin' my eyes out, gotta get it back with you

I woke up early
With everythin' blurry
And my head rattled with pain
Even so, I heard the doorbell go
And someone call my name

There was her best friend
Down for the weekend
I knew I'd met her before
She said: you dirty man
When I see Mary Ann
I'm gonna tell her the score

Mary Ann, I'm gonna do what I can
But I can't do more than try
Tearin' my heart out tryin' to make it up to you
Mary Ann, I'm gonna do what I can
That's truth, and that's no lie
Cryin' my eyes out, gotta get it back with you

Out on a late night
Way after midnight
Armed with a bottle or two
What's the time?
I'm gettin' out of my mind
I've got to get to you

Mary Ann, I'm gonna do what I can
But I can't do more than try
Tearin' my heart out tryin' to make it up to you
Mary Ann, I'm gonna do what I can
That's truth, and that's no lie
Cryin' my eyes out, gotta get it back with you

Cryin' my eyes out, gotta get it back with you"
Heute in Jerusalem,"Today in Jerusalem
Get up, lay down the sleep
In this time of bitter fruits
Friend, be vigilant
To fight against the crying and tears
Look, from the cold high sky
Fall a hundred moons
As a sign for the new beginning
As a sense against the nonsense
And today in Jerusalem
Finally in Jerusalem
Take breath and reflect
Today in Jerusalem
Peace for Jerusalem
Look, from the cold high sky
Fall a hundred moons
As a sign for the new beginning
As a sense against the nonsense

Su canción,"Walking alone in my town
 I felt that a song was coming to me
 I approached and I could see
 Some children singing One came and told me: “Hey, old woman!”
 “Don’t you want to include your weary voice?”
 “You’ll see how easy it is to sing”
 “If your heart is very happy” If everybody wanted a song
 That speaks of peace, that speaks of love
 It would be easy to get us together
 To live with an illusion I want you to feel this song with me
 To leave behind your bad mood
 So you can step into life with a smile
 And enjoy your condition Sing my song at home alone
 You’ll understand that there’s no pain
 When you have the joy of living
 And a heart to share Close your eyes with me and say goodbye
 To that song which taught me
 To live today, not yesterday
 A song which is of us both is your song (Lala lalala lalala…)
Lalalala… lalalala…

Before you came it was dark everywhere
The world was empty and dull, I wonder why
I searched everywhere for sweet light
For a flame that would warm my heart

Illuminating my day and night, my life was wonderful
Now, all of a sudden, everything has changed

I wonder who else suffers from your love
You speak of nothing but dollars and marks
I am so suffering because of you
Rich courtesans are running after you
Dreams and reality are not the same, you won't be mine
Maybe you'll go away for good some day
I already started crying after you

I would  always remember
Every single moment
I'd been living with you My hands
Are empty, but
I can't hide
The love I feel
Always for you
In the depth of my soul
I wonder why
I'll still want you in my arms once again I wonder what I would give
To still the time
That I could sleep on your side
Just one more night
I wonder what I would give, that you'd feel yourself mine
and draw you close, just one more night Then the star and the moon above should disappear and you
With the wings of a swan would fly down here My hands
Are empty, but
I can't hide

Will hang on, for we've together chosen

To the extraordinary and magic world of cinema Peter Pan, he was the tallest

Huilumies,"A flute man
Here's a flute and a flute man
I'm not playing to the standards
I flute away my troubles
If I can't interpret my feelings with words
My flute surely plays for them
And from them the sounds of my soul created my little song
There is the smell of the morning dew
The warmth of spring, the running water of the mountain stream
My flute plays everything I feel
There is the darkening night, the colours of the sun
The never ending belief in a better future
There is autumn's sadness, there is the pain of life
My flute plays all that
Here's a flute and a flute man
I see nature as a painting, I will play it all to you in a song
And this is how joy, sorrow and everyday life sounds
If I can't feel them right
Every disappointment, laughter is a reason for a song
There is the beautiful flight of a butterfly
The last flight of a fading star
My flute plays everything I feel
There is the chilly frost of the snowy winter
The smallness of man under the universe
There is autumn's sadness, there is the pain of life
My flute plays all that
There is the beautiful flight of a butterfly
The last flight of a fading star
My flute plays everything I feel
There is the chilly frost of the snowy winter
The smallness of man under the universe
There is autumn's sadness, there is the pain of life
My flute plays all that"

Theater,"They put a mask on every evening
And they play the role they have to play
They have sold their hearts to the theatre
They're standing up there and those below look at them
They're kings, beggars, clowns in the footlight
But how it looks deep inside them, you can't see Theatre, theatre, the curtain opens
Then the stage becomes the world
Theatre, theatre, it's like an intoxication
And it's only the moment that counts Like a burning fever, like a piece of happiness
A long forgotten dream comes back to life
Theatre, theatre, hated and loved
Heaven and hell at the same time And the clown has to laugh, even if he wants to cry
And the audience doesn't see that a tear is rolling down
And the hero has to be strong, and fight for the right
But often he's got stage fright Everything is just like theatre, but it's also reality
Theatre, the gateway to fantasy
Theatre, theatre, only those stay true to you
Who love you with a passion Theatre, theatre
(And the clown has to laugh)
Is life and dream
(Even if he wants to cry)
Beginning and ending at the same time
(And the audience doesn't see that a tear is rolling down) Theatre, theatre
(And the hero has to be strong)
You give us the applause
(And fight for the right)
We give everything for you
(But often he's got stage fright) And laugh and cry for you
(Theatre, theatre)
Yes, we give everything for you"

It isn't every day you meet someone
You wanna pin your wildest dreams upon
It's true you haven't known me very long
But I hope and pray that you'll stay

There's something in the way you touch my soul
It seemed that I was half, but now I'm whole
You've got me under your complete control
In every way

If there's a place in your heart for me
There's a room in my place for you

What's Another Year,"I've been waiting such a long time
Looking out for you
But you're not here
What's another year?

I've been waking such a long time
Reaching out for you
But you're not near
What's another year?

What's another year
To someone who's lost everything that he owns?
What's another year
To someone who's getting used to being alone?

I've been praying such a long time
It's the only way to hide the fear
What's another year?

What's another year
To someone who's lost everything that he owns?
What's another year
To someone who's getting used to being alone?

I've been crying such a long time
With such a lot of pain in every tear

What's another year?
To someone who is getting used to being alone
What's another year?
For someone who is getting used to being alone
What's another year?
To someone who is getting used to being alone"
Quédate esta noche,"Sleep with me this night
Stay with me this night
Love me a lot this night
I'll be yours this night Let go the keys and put the case
back again in its place
Think that ther's no reason to be angry
and even to leave without saying why
Come to my arms and tell me what's going on,
I want to save our love
If maybe I made a fault,
I want to apologize. Leave your stuff and come,
we'll talk later
And now stay here I want to say
how much I need you
Together we will see
on that great window
The morning coming and sitting at your feet
when you're enjoying my love"

What should I say if tonight is a party?
The stars are nervous

Eurovision, Eurovision, Eurovision Old Europe cheers
The country that wins
Then a tear
The spell is broken The eyes of the whole world are
Waiting, impatiently, for news flashes
That are going to announce
By satellite and by shielded cables
What's happening in their regions Eurovision, Eurovision, Eurovision

Wenn du da bist,"When you're here
When you are gone
And though all the birds are singing
When you are gone
And though the flowers are blooming
I'm lonely
And all the people around me are behaving
As if nothing had happened
When you are gone
I don't hear the birds' song
When you are gone
The sun itself shines dimly
Whatever I do, everything is bland and lost
Then I miss you so much
But when you are here
And I breathe close to you
When you are close to me
And I look in the eyes
When you are here
And I take you in my arms
We are forgetting the world around us
When you are here
I see the tree blooming again
When you are here
I see the flowers blooming again
When you are here
I wish so much:
Please never don't go again
When you are gone
I walk around without any aim
Totally lost
I feel hollowed and empty
When you are gone
I have no more plans
Then I miss you so much
But when you are here
And I breathe close to you
When you are close to me
And I look in the eyes
When you are here
And I take you in my arms
We are forgetting the world around us
When you are here
I see the tree blooming again
When you are here
I see the flowers blooming again
When you are here
I wish so much:
Please never don't go again"

Johnny Blue,"Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue
Everybody is singing your songs
Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue
And the whole world is listening He grew up without any friends
Because no one wanted to play
With someone who was blind, like him
And he mostly sat at home
The boys outside
They just shouted after him They shouted
Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue
What colour is the sun?
Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue
Children can be cruel On the old guitar
That somebody gave him
He played, it was his friend
His songs, they sounded
Of hope and joy
And sometimes as if someone was crying And he sang
Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue
What colour is the sun?
Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue
And all the children were listening And soon nobody could play like him
(Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue)
His songs touched people’s hearts
(What colour is the sun?) And he painted colours with his music
(Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue)
And forgot all his pain And soon tens of thousands
Came to his concerts
Because he gave them the power To believe in the future
In the darkness of life
He had made it himself Oh, Johnny Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue
And they all kept coming back
Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue
Nobody plays as beautifully as you Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue
Everybody is singing your songs

C'est peut-être pas l'Amérique,"It may not be America
But America isn’t everything
I’ve got music in my heart
And this music means a lot to me
It comes from the north of the Provence
As Tramontane or Mistral
It’s the fiddle to dance to
Or the choral in the cathedral It sings during my evening parties
And rocks my nights when I feel a bit down
It’s a ballad or a ditty
It’s piano, it’s guitar It may not be America
But America isn’t everything
I’ve got music in my heart
And this music means a lot to me It comes from the depths of my memories
Even before we were born
It tells us our story
Our roots and our past If the universe is stormy
If the earth is shaking underneath our feet
We’ll go on with our journey
So that it will never stop singing It may not be America
But America isn’t everything
I’ve got music in my heart
And this music means a lot to me (It may not be America)
(But America isn’t everything)
I’ve got music in my heart
And this music means a lot to me"

You give my life new courage, a little glow
A warm tingling in my blood, a love dance
A new chance, it’s a wonder At first being happy didn’t mean much to me
I didn’t have any experience, on the contrary
Falling down and getting up without comments
And in silence I made both ends meet It’s a wonder

Horoscopes,"Rushing for the papers every day
To find out what the stars have got to say
About the fortunes that are on the way
It's crazy, crazy

Working, not waiting that forever will hold
Success comes from what we do, not from what we're told
And counting on lucky stars is living on false hopes

Don't let the planets take control of our lives
Believe in the truth and not celestial lies
It's we, not the stars above, who write our horoscopes

Virgos and Arians, Leos, Aquarians
Pisces, Cancerians show
No matter when we're born
Libra or Capricorn
Taureans and Scorpions know

Nothing can change the way we've chosen to live
And no one can tell us when to take or to give
It's we, not the stars above, who write our horoscopes

Yet, in spite of this, when daylight dies
There we are, with eyes turned to the sky
All anxious to be told a few more lies
Still crazy, crazy

Working, not waiting that forever will hold
Success comes from what we do, not from what we're told
And counting on lucky stars is living on false hopes

Don't let the planets take control of our lives
Believe in the truth and not celestial lies
It's we, not the stars above, who write our horoscopes

Throw away almanacs, signs of the Zodiac
Then there is sense to be found
They are celestial, we are terrestrial
Let's keep our feet on the ground

Don't let the planets take control of our lives
Believe in the truth and not celestial lies
It's we, not the stars above, who write our horoscopes

It's we, not the stars above, who write our horoscopes"
Aldri i livet,"The twilight is humming away a soft sadless song

every time I go away Never in my life have I
thought about leaving you
Never in my life my friend
before I follow the wind You have given life a new harmoni
the time in loneliness has past
I have been blinded but now I can see
Baby because you have thaugt me Every time I go away
Do you think of me?
every time I go away
don't forget the promise I gave Never in my life have I
thought about leaving you
never in my life my friend
before I follow the wind Never in my life have I
thought about leaving you
Never in my life my friend
before I follow the wind"
Making Your Mind Up,"[Chorus]
You gotta speed it up and then you gotta slow it down
'Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top you gotta play around
But soon you will find that there comes a time
For making your mind up

[Verse 1]
You gotta turn it on and then you gotta put it out
You gotta be sure that it's something everybody's gonna talk about
Before you decide that the times arrived
For making your mind up

[Refrain]
Don't let your indecision take you from behind
Trust your inner vision
Don't let others change your mind

[Verse 2]
And then you really gotta burn it up and make another fly by night
Get a run for your money and take a chance and it'll turn out right
And when you can see how it's gotta be
You're making your mind up

[Verse 3]
And try to look as if you don't care less but if you want to see some more
Bending the rules of the game will let you find the one you're looking for
And then you can show that you think you know
You're making your mind up

[Refrain]
Don't let your indecision, take you from behind
Trust your inner vision
Don't let others change your mind

[Chorus]
You gotta speed it up and then you gotta slow it down
'Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top you gotta play around
But soon you will find that there comes a time
For making your mind up
You gotta speed it up and then you gotta slow it down
'Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top you gotta play around
But soon you will find that there comes a time
For making your mind up
For making your mind up
For making your mind up
For making your mind up"

And even without singing, you’re going to enchant
In playback, in playback, in playback Open your mouth, close your mouth
Don’t make mistakes, don’t stop breathing
You’re going to be worshipped, perform to delight In playback, you sing in tune
Singing without missing the notes
In playback, miming, long live playback
You’ll always sing With playback, they even ask for an encore
“But of course”, you’ll say happily
In playback, miming, long live playback
You thank and smile Maybe you don’t know how to sing or even how to whistle
But you won’t sing out of tune for sure
In playback, in playback, in playback You just have to get it right, there’s nothing to it

 I don’t breathe if you are not here
 Me without you, what shall I be?

 And find words that are never said
 While the sun dies in my heart, you’ll stay Me without you, what shall I do
 With my life and my days?
 Me without you, how shall I do it?
 My love, I must invent you Me without you, what shall I do?

Captured in a dream, you're held back by your fantasy
Yes, captured once more and if only you could escape
Still captured in a dream, you remain until the day is dawning
In a dream, in a dream In a time when the world is supposed to be logical
In a time when fairy tales don't fit in
You see reality fall apart with chills in your skin
And though you're screaming out your fear, no sounds are heard And captured in a dream that doesn't set you free
Captured in a dream, you're held back by your fantasy
Yes, captured once more and if only you could escape
Still captured in a dream, you remain until the day is dawning Captured in a dream that doesn't set you free
Captured in a dream, you're held back by your fantasy
In a dream, in a dream

The same way we did the last time I went away from you I will always remember you as a friend
In case we never see each other again We've got our memories
That will never die
Now the time has come
To say ""goodbye"" Tell me, what does ""goodbye"" mean?
Can it be any good if everything is over?
Believe me, we will say goodbye
In a loving way if we break apart forever I will always remember you as a friend
In case we never see each other again We've got our memories
That will never die
Now the time has come
To say ""goodbye"" Goodbye"
One Step Further,"One step further and I would have been there

Can't seem to get your attention no matter how I try
I just want you to prefer me to the other guys
So when you looked at me, you only turned away
So I walked up beside you
But I forgot all the things that I planned to say
I don't know if I tried to

I could have taken one step further
And I would have been there
You could have turned around
And hit me and I wouldn't have cared
All this time I didn't get anywhere
I could have taken one step further
And I would have been there

Ain't got the courage to speak when you're sometimes near
Well I can't seem to think of the things that a girl likes to hear
But when I saw you again, you were all alone
So I walked up beside you
But I was too shy to even ask you home
I don't know if I tried to

I could have taken one step further
And I would have been there
You could have turned around
And hit me and I wouldn't have cared
All this time I didn't get anywhere
I could have taken one step further
And I would have been there

If you read my letters or my telegrams
You'd have got around to asking me just who I am
'Cause you know I'm gonna get ya
I'm gonna get ya, I'm gonna get ya

One step further and I would have been there
You could have turned around
And hit me and I wouldn't have cared
All this time I didn't get anywhere
I could have taken one step further
And I would have been...

One step further and I would have been there
You could have turned around
And hit me and I wouldn't have cared
All this time I didn't get anywhere

One step further and I would have been there
You could have turned around
And hit me and I wouldn't have cared
All this time I didn't get anywhere

Amour on t'aime,"We can cross the ocean, fly around the world
Live an adventure, search for gold
We can leave our fatherland, have our nosew and our lives fixed
But most of all, we need love Love, we love you, more than ourselves
More than money, politics and songs
And even if you tie us up
Our hearts still keep beating like the wings of a butterfly We can believe in fantasy, have wide interests
Think in terms of Rossini or Travolta
We can speed up, do yoga or business
But without love, it's just not the same Love, we love you against our will
You rock us like sailors in the wind
And even if you hold the reins
We feel free and we fly around like seagulls Love, we love you against our will
You carry us along like fish in the ocean
And yet love the way you guide us
It's a bit foolish but we can't live in any other way Love, we love you, more than ourselves
More than money, politics and songs
Love, we love you, love, we love each other
Our eyes are full of laughter and lampions
Our hearts keep beating like the wings of a butterfly"

At home on my little island

Like Friday and Robinson On Sunday I need a little time for myself
Just a little rest, no rush, no watch Sunny Sunday or rainy Sunday
On every Sunday I feel wonderful
Because from Sunday-morning to Sunday-evening
I'm lying in my four-poster bed Every Sunday starts on Monday
Is getting good on Wednesday
And lasts then until Friday
And Saturday is nearly Sunday

So many days, and yet it never fades
See how it's moving your feet

And do the Hora, it helps every way
It makes every day, we dance and we say
It's just the Hora, it's taking away
The sadness each day, and bringing just love

And I know, if you care in the greatest gifts
We can start by just doing this dance
And all our pain will melt before the dawn
Let's give the future a chance

The sadness each day, and bringing just love

Is in bloom again, stands bride again
And my dreams are coming true

Have found each other again
We’ll be joined forever
No matter what way we go You and I
Will always find each other

That we’ll go home together Look, along every road stands a cross
That’s the long way home

Have finished their journey

Ein bißchen Frieden,"Like a flower at the beginning of winter
and like a fire in an icy wind.
Like a doll, no one loves anymore,
this is how i feel on some days.
Then I see the clouds, above me and you
and hear the cries of the birds in the wind
I'm singing because I'm afraid of the dark
and hope that nothing's going to happen. A little bit of peace, a little bit of sun
on this earth, we all live on.
A little bit of peace, a little bit of happiness,
A little bit of warmth, is what I'm whishing for.
A little bit of peace, a little bit of dreaming
and that the people don't cry so often.
A little bit of peace, a little bit of love,
that I'll never lose hope again. I know that my songs, won't change so many things
I am just a girl, who says what she feels
alone I am helpless, a bird in the wind
who feels that a storm is brewing. A little bit of peace, a little bit of sun
on this earth, we all live on.
A little bit of peace, a little bit of happiness,
A little bit of warmth, is what I'm whishing for.
A little bit of peace, a little bit of dreaming
and that the people don't cry so often.
A little bit of peace, a little bit of love,
that I'll never lose hope again. Sing with me a little song,
that the world lives in peace.
Sing with me a little song,
that the world lives in peace"

Love, even if you need to leave They told each other goodbye, maybe forever
But deep down in their eyes, oh, how they loved each other
And the tour of days will bring them
Towards another forever, towards eternity
Far, far, so far, like a star, a point To live, to live another day
To live another love
To live another awakening
Drunk, stuffed with sun Love, love like a crazy
Love, love on your knees
Yes, even if you should suffer
Love, even if you need to leave What do seasons matter, what does time matter?
Beyond the horizon, nothing is important
They cross the night in the depths of their eyes
A gleaming flame, love in goodbyes
Far, far, so far, like a star, a point At the first glimmers they embarked
The killers' rifles will soon sound
You must finally die, they say, what do you want?

You are hiding a secret too
Stars, I see them, I would like to take one down for you There beyond the sky is an eternity
If you want to discover it here with me
Take the first step and show me the way tonight A feeling and I trust it
Then our love will never be strange again The night is there for you and me
Forget what’s around us
Let me come, let me be close to you Just like Mona Lisa has her smile
You are hiding a secret too

Per Lucia,"Good evening when you'll be here
You'll take off the Winter
And you'll hang it up
You'll have two arms
As big as a forest
And the calm after the storm Find again for Lucia
The whitest sheet
And then start again
I'd like, for instance
To tie her hair
With a thread of wind There will be for Lucia
The fullest moon
But it won't be enough
I'd like, as I keep going,
A sea of corn
To cherish her once in a while Goodnight when you'll turn off
You'll wear the stars and you'll dream
You'll have a calm sea
Where to sail into
And silence
When you'll want to speak For delicate Lucia
I'll be her shadow
Drawn on the street
I'd like, for instance
To open for her the doors
Which close the world It takes few things for Lucia
She alone fills
Your emptiest day
I wish so much
To give her back a smile
On her slightly tired face What's on the other side of the wall?
Hold your breath and then jump towards me
The rifle shots are far yet
We'll open the sky with our hands Long live Lucia
And water from the river
For all her wounds
I want bright lights
The biggest party
Through all the town For scared Lucia
May this pen of mine
Become a sword
With Lucia by my side
May the story keep going
On the next page"

Io così non ci sto,"It doesn't work for me like this, I don't agree
Whether you do it for love or not even,
It leaves the sign of an adventure,
A woman always puts a bit back in
Falling in love doesn't make sense
You've always been with her If maybe it's fun, to spend a night
To combat boredom, I'm not like this
If it's just to make love once, and then it's enough
For a rash decision without any emotion Nor feeling, nothing here inside
I don't agree to it like this And then who will it be, who of the two of us
To remain with the doubt in their heart
It will be me, it will be me, it won't be you
Instead you, as if it were nothing,
Tonight you'll return to her If maybe it's fun, to spend a night
To combat boredom, I'm not like this
If it's just to make love once, and then it's enough
For a rash decision without any emotion Nor feeling, nothing here inside
I don't agree to it like this If maybe it's fun, to spend a night
To combat boredom, I'm not like this
If it's just to make love once, and then it's enough
For a rash decision without any emotion Nor feeling, nothing here inside
I don't agree to it like this"
Fantasiaa,"Who is he and what is the language that he speaks?
Who is he? I wish that he would come close to me
What is he? He spends the days walking his dog
Who is he and where does he disappear to? Is this a fantasy or the beginning of a crush?
He strokes the dog and I watch jealously
There's no sound in the park, I don't see anyone
Is this just a daydream or my imagination? Is this a fantasy or just a sad story?
He gets into a black car and I'm left alone again
When I see the stop lights I hope in silence again
That he finally had noticed a woman in love (Time goes by, cheeks will dry)
(Everything you touch turns to rust)
(Tomorrow is a sound of yesterday) Who is he and what brings him again to this park?
What is the reason he gives tenderness to his pet?
Who is he? I may never find this out
What is this? Is this just a dream? Is this a fantasy or the beginning of a crush?
Is this a fantasy or the beginning of a crush?
He strokes the dog and I watch jealously
There's no sound in the park, I don't see anyone
Is this just a daydream or my imagination? Is this a fantasy or just a sad story?
He gets into a black car and I'm left alone again
When I see the stop lights I hope in silence again
That he finally had noticed a woman...
Finally noticed a woman in love"
Mou les (Μου λες),"You tell me about seas and ships, and my heart like a bird
In your bosom hushes, and wherever you go, it follows you
In your bosom hushes, and wherever you go, it follows you

And the stations so that you won’t be lost from me
Your mind I’ll imprison
So that you cease feeling nostalgia any longer
Your mind I’ll imprison
So that you cease feeling nostalgia any longer
You tell me about trains that keep leaving, and gypsies that move
And I read your eyes, to see where they run, where they wander
And I read your eyes, to see where they run, where they wander
I’ll close all the ports
And the stations so that you won’t be lost from me
Your mind I’ll imprison

Džuli (Џули),"She came alone with summer, came and said ""hello""
Our looks spoke more than words
Like star from sky landed on my palm
Only thing I knew about her was that her name is Julie Julie, Julie, and I wanted this dream to last long I still remember touch of that hand, face and her gentle look
At the moment it became clear that I love her madly
Like all summer dreams, day took her away from me, too
Just memory about one July stayed I ask sky at nights, was that a dream
Or Julie really kissed me at that night
I walked next to sea, I wait a day so
I ask sea to give me Julie and July back"

Rücksicht,"I can’t be alone
With all these unanswered questions
What did we both do wrong?
I still don’t want to see any people
The luck of the others still hurts me
Why didn’t we wake up earlier?
We were like spoiled children
Everyone only thought of himself Consideration – nobody knew this word
And leniency – which nobody found at the other
And care – that never breaks what connected us Insight – that everyone has his mistakes
And far-sight – life doesn’t only take place today
And caution – that you don’t break the other Were we really just blind of love
Or just too easygoing?
Didn’t we notice what we were missing?
Perhaps everything was going much too fast for us
Did only the night connect us?
Didn’t we know that the day counts as well?
Did we lack the power to trust ourselves?
Was it fear for honest feelings? Consideration – nobody knew this word
And leniency – which nobody found at the other
And care – that never breaks what connected us Insight – that everyone has his mistakes
And far-sight – life doesn’t only take place today
And caution – that you don’t break the other"
Kloden drejer,"The planet turns

Float on cloud nine A rough sea in the souls mind
An SOS that makes me so blind
Perhaps together we could
Break the ties, please let me in The planet turns
Everything grows again
People meet
Float on cloud nine A shooting star makes the way
For people like you and me
A candle is lit and the night sees
Yet again two people laughing The planet turns
Everything grows again
People meet
Float on cloud nine A thousand stars show the way
They only twinkle for you and I
You and I The planet turns
Everything grows again
People meet
Float on cloud nine The planet turns
Everything grows again
People meet
Float on cloud nine
Float on cloud nine"
Khay (חי),"All the men in the neighborhood
Carry their eyes up to me
They say, ""You're beautiful like a picture
Like the sun at dusk""
And they all lay out their nets for me
And they all want and want
But I only ask for mercy [also: Rachamim]
Rachamim, oh Rachamim
Watch and observe
And you might also notice
How in the vineyard there will bloom
A rose amongst the thorns
For you, oh Rachamim
For you, oh Rachamim
They all whistle to me at their window
But I can't hear it
My heart is like a telephone
At the Welfare Office
Busy for two months now
No connection, no phone lines
And they're all on their knees

Watch and observe
And you might also notice
How in the vineyard there will bloom
A rose amongst the thorns

A rose amongst the thorns
For you, oh Rachamim

But if I'll leave without escaping
My feet would go to you
Oh Rachamim, when will you lay
Your mercy over me
So we could go out to the street
Embraced like two lovebirds
And I'll be glowing

Esta balada que te dou,"This ballad that I give you
She says I was a very serious case
But only I know that there's something abnormal to that
There was a time, a look, a smile, a beginning
But now everything has lost its glow
In my life there was only one hug like yours
A dream, a book, an adventure without equal
It's pretty, pretty, this ballad that I give you
It's pretty, pretty, this ballad that I give you
You might even think that I'm a bit sad
But there's nothing wrong with being this way
For when everything is over
A romance, a passionate amour or a way
In my life there was only one hug like yours
A dream, a book, an adventure without equal
It's pretty, pretty, this ballad that I give you
It's pretty, pretty, this ballad that I give you
I wanted to write the most beautiful song in the world
Looking back to see ourselves
It was when I heard a bass voice singing
This ballad which came from far away
In my life there was only one hug like yours
A dream, a book, an adventure without equal
In my life there was only one hug like yours
A dream, a book, an adventure without equal
It's pretty, pretty, this ballad that I give you

But nobody is waiting for me
I'm spinning right round in the twister
Of stormy feelings
Such a hurricane, hurricane, hurricane
Thunderstorm of love
Hurricane, hurricane, hurricane
Thunderstorm of love is taking us away
Then I finally found her
After empty, dark hours
But destiny was not on our side
Now I'm standing in the rain
Such a hurricane, hurricane, hurricane
Thunderstorm of love
Hurricane, hurricane, hurricane
Thunderstorm of love is taking us away
I live in my fantasies
And I hunt the rainbow
Did we cheat ourselves?
Cheat ourselves...

Our love would have been enough

Given present, taken back gift, stolen present
Take love as a gift
Given present, taken back gift, stolen present
Happiness is too short Us, it was the child I wanted badly
To offer you in Spring But time has got all the rights
So, why having promised me the entire world?
And the child that is not there?
Now it is my only  imaginary happiness
If life is a gift If life is a gift
Given present, taken back gift, stolen present

There are sighs on the telephone
Which prevent us from sleeping
On my radio there are too many songs
Which make my heart like a ragged doll
Above towns there are airplanes
And stars which turn around
Where are the horses of the merry-go-round?
Where are the gods who protect us?
Give me hundred percent of love
To share it every day
With the sky, with the people, oh...
Give me hundred percent of love
I would like to do something
With blue, with pink
To change the eyes of the earth
Which look at films in reverse
I imagine a video clip
In which children speak to birds
We have sound without pictures
We have the sea, but not the beach
Give me hundred percent of love
To share it every day
With the sky, with the people, oh...
Give me hundred percent of love
If you have in your hands
Old dreams that are useless
Give me hundred percent of love
To share it every day
With the sky, with the people, oh...
Give me hundred percent of love

To share it every day
With the sky, with the people, oh...

Enough of the detours that watch you Go further, go further with your life
Don't listen to the laws
You'd die through them, fo further
All the liberties scold in you (go further, go further with life) Nor servant, nor king
(Be a poet without executioner, go) Sing as loud as you can
(With ink and with words, go further) Go further with your life
(Write as the fool at the bottom of you) The train of time often stops
Profit of it, change course Go further, go further in life
Help yourself, Heaven will help you

Terminal 3,"Long distance USA, last night I heard him say
He's been away too long, now he's coming home
Be on the morning plane, if I still feel the same
I should be waiting 'cause he'd be all alone

I'm in Arrivals by the time he had said
I search the information board and it read
""Terminal Three: flight's on time""

Staring into a space, searching through every face
He's been away too long now, he must have changed
Another time and place can never quite erase
The way he turned his back and walked away

I repeated all the words he had said
Until a voice came through into my head
""Terminal Three: flight's on time""

Fly to me on the wings of all you meant to me
Memories of the dreams that all tomorrow can be
For you and me
""Terminal Three: flight's on time""

Fly to me on the wings of all you meant to me
Memories of the dreams that all tomorrow can be
For you and me

Could I be waiting 'cause he'd be all alone
I told him nothing's changed and I still feel the same
He's been away too long

Come on home (Long distance USA, last night I heard him say)
Come on home (Could I be waiting 'cause he'd be all alone)
Come on home (I told him nothing's changed and I still feel the same)

Despite all this I'm gonna Walk with my head held high, walk with my head held high
Finally I've learned:
When I fall, I'm gonna get back on my feet
With pride in my eyes and despite the tears on my face
Walk with my head held high through the night into the light When you come back
I know that day may come soon
It's all for naught
For I'm not gonna wait for you
And when we meet
I will hardly look your way
And when I get weak
I tell myself sternly to Walk with my head held high, walk with my head held high
Finally I've learned:
When I fall, I'm gonna get back on my feet
With pride in my eyes and despite the tears on my face
Walk with my head held high through the night into the light My silence is still bitter
And my laughter still sounds a little shrill
My soul still feels a splinter
And I still don't know when it will end
Yet I'm gonna Walk with my head held high, walk with my head held high
Finally I've learned:
When I fall, I'm gonna get back on my feet
With pride in my eyes and despite the tears on my face
Walk with my head held high through the night into the light"
Halay,"Halay
The ground will tremble, fellows, when the Halay is danced
We love in a different way
We are exuberant like torrents, like gusting winds
We don't look upon foreigners as strangers
Let blooms blossom on the bough
We have so many beautiful things
Let's sing old love songs
To the whole world
Let's sing old love songs
To the whole world
Hand in hand, we play and dance the halay
With affection, we play and dance the halay
Let everyone take a place on this floor
Let drums beat and rejoice
Let the troubadour strike the strings of his lute
So lovely is this tune
Let's weave a web of friendship
Let's cross over those unyielding mountains
Let's sing old love songs
To the whole world
Let's sing old love songs
To the whole world

Hengaillaan,"22:45, the last train has left, but never mind that
Track two, already at five thirty, there's another leaving in the morning (Refrain:)
Tonight we just are and hang out
Won't go to sleep
We'll play and jam at the station, waiting for the train That last train took my bag
The trains are in a hurry, I'm not
You can always get in the train of life Zero, two the clock is ticking
Just the two of us at the station, no one else in sight
The blues has been playing for an hour or two,
and it's an eternity 'till morning (Refrain) That last train took my bag
The trains are in a hurry, I'm not
You can expand the world view in other ways Track two, and a new morning, we're late again
It's six o'clock

The whole day we'll play and jam Today we just are and hang out

Welche Farbe hat der Sonnenschein?,"I've always wondered as a kid
How they could draw up a map of the world
And who knew that someone like a cartographer1could possibly do that. So beautifully colored, and rife with sunlight
I saw it every day, and even at night
And I ask myself the same question every time: What color is sunshine?
What color is the world?
Is it blue like the open sea?
Or high as the firmament above? What color is sunshine?
Does it cast only a shadow, or simply light?
See the world with open eyes
Lest you miss the wonders thereof. How does one see happiness?2Is it a fine reddish color?
How does one perceive pain? What color is strife?
And how does one see hunger and affliction? What color is sunshine?
What color is the world?
Is it blue like the open sea?
Or high as the firmament above? What color is sunshine?
There are pictures of plentiful colors
Such as those you see here on earth
That go hand-in-hand with your feelings."
I treni di Tozeur,"In the border villages, they watch the trains pass,
The deserted streets of Tozeur1 From a far-off house, your mother sees me
She remembers me and my habits And for a moment, the wanting to live
At a different speed returns They still pass slowly, the trains to Tozeur In the abandoned churches they prepare refuges
And new spaceships for interstellar trips In an old mine, expanses of salt
And a memory of me, like a charm And for a moment, the wanting to live
At a different speed returns They still pass slowly, the trains to Tozeur In the border villages, they watch the passing
Trains to Tozeur"
Silêncio e tanta gente,"Sometimes it’s in the midst of silence
I find love in the look of your eyes
It’s a stone,
it’s a shout
Born anywhere Sometimes it’s in the midst of so many people
I find at last what I am
I’m a shout
 or I’m a stone
From a place where I’m not Sometimes I’m the time running slowly
And what no one wants to believe Sometimes I’m also
a happy yes
or a sad no
And I give my life for a day of illusion
And I give my life for a day of illusion Sometimes it’s in the midst of silence
I find the words to say
It’s a stone
 or it’s a shout
Of a love yet to happen Sometimes it’s in the midst of so many people
I find at last where I’m going
And this stone,
and this shout
Is the story of what I am Sometimes I’m the time running slowly
And what no one wants to believe Sometimes I’m also
 a happy yes
or a sad no
And I give my life for a day of illusion

Eläköön elämä,"It's night in the city but I don't see any stars
A thousand stars aren't shining
They're left behind a grey veil
It's night in the city, I stayed in the park with you
You're standing in front me full of hope
And your eyes are telling me this Long live life and the night
Long live the dark sky and the belt of stars
Wish like I do that a star doesn't hit a star
The feeling of sympathy
Which grandfather told of is what the earth needs
So that the children of the world can watch the stars It's night in the city, I see your starry eyes
Under a good friends arm
I'll hide my furry head
I am happy because I stayed with you
You're standing in front of me full of hope
And your eyes are telling me this Long live life and the night
Long live the dark sky and the belt of stars
Wish like I do that a star doesn't hit a star

To katalava arga (Το κατάλαβα αργά),"Another day gone without a purpose
I’m alone in empty time in this world
In my bedroom, looking down again
Only happiness, when thinking of the past
You finished like a melodious song
You were a small musical piece
Your scent stayed like a note on paper
A living stamp of a loving moment I loved you, I kept you in my life
But you’re gone and loneliness breaks me
I had a desire of locking you in my heart
But it was wrong, I realised it too late I’ll always remember you as a feast
A loving and eternal icon
A sweet memory you won’t vanish
A secret hope you’ll be back I loved you, I kept you in my life
But you’re gone and loneliness breaks me
I had a desire of locking you in my heart
But it was wrong, I realised it too late I had a desire of locking you in my heart

Sku' du spørg' fra no'en?,"Would you like to know?
An hour passed, well probably more
And I keep speculating:
Now, who was it, that you were?
Then I finally got an answer, it was obvious
When we were kids we were friends
In the yard at home, we often played theatre
When someone asked who we should look like, you'd answer:
Would you like to know? (Do you dare or not?)
Would you like to know, then just ask me
Come along to our dream island
Where you can get exactly what you want
Would you like to know? (Say it once more)
Would you like to know? Don't you see
If you want to, we'll go to
The place where everything can happen
I cautiously went to the jockey of the place
And asked for something with a bit less rock
I saw you get up and come this way
Straight towards me
Did you still remember me? I think so
You wanted to dance with me, but as you asked
I couldn't really help laughing and saying:
Would you like to know? (Do you dare or not?)
Would you like to know, then just ask me
Come along to our dream island
Where you can get exactly what you want
Would you like to know? (Say it once more)
Would you like to know? Don't you see

There's no more magic in your hands
Love, excuse me if I say love
It wasn't my intention
Maybe it's because I loved you
And now I don't The party's over

Again to my old tricks

Für alle,"How many people lie awake
On a clear, starry night?
They really don't  know what tomorrow might bring
And yet, they dream about it. They believe in affection,
That a gleam of hope remains
In small things and a far-off goal
And also in a feeling. For all those here who see the rainbow, even in the dark
And the truth lying in secret
For everyone here who understands the unspoken words
For everyone, I sing a song to them. For everything here, for the longing in a child's eyes
For the dreams, and for the fantasy
And for the courage that overcomes doubt and fear
For everyone, I sing a song. Thoughts often turn in circles
Every dream has its price
Yet as long as there are still people here
The longing will still have a song For everyone here who sees the rainbow, even in the dark
And the truth lying in secret
For everyone here who understands the unspoken words
For everyone, I sing a song to them. For everything here, for the longing in a child's eyes
For the dreams, and for imagination
And for the courage that overcomes doubt and fear
For everyone, I sing a song."

We resemble and if you are cut in two
Somehow you may think I’m your other half Some differences will always separate us
You will embitter me and I may scold you somehow
However the moments will always unite us
Which make the pain more human We resemble like two drops of rain
And whatever words you say are secrets in your anger
We resemble and if you are cut in two
Somehow you may think I’m your other half We resemble like two drops of rain
And whatever words you say are secrets in your anger
We resemble and if you are cut in two
Somehow you may think I’m your other half We resemble"
L'amour de ma vie,"I've got so much love in me for no reason
My heart beats so much for no reason
That I'm willing to leave someday because of love Towards the man who'll tell me for no reason
Things that aren't said for no reason
Words more beautiful than children
Stronger, bigger and higher than volcanoes I'll fly without wings for the love of my life
I'll make up suns (and) days in the middle of the night
I'll change time to keep longer
The love of my life I dream of a smile for no reason
Of a rose he'll give me for no reason
And of a look coloured with hope
like stars at night shine in the dark I'll fly without wings for the love of my life
I'll make up suns (and) days in the middle of the night
I'll change time to keep longer
The love of my life I'll fly without wings for the love of my life
I'll make up suns (and) days in the middle of the night
I'll change time to keep longer
The love of my life I'll fly without wings for the love of my life
I'll make up suns (and) days in the middle of the night
I'll change time to keep longer
The love of my life"
Željo moja,"I loved you and I still love you
I'm honestly giving everything
This night is black without you If I'm fortunate you will return
My punishment, my sin
Quietly, quietly tear, dont give in Refren (Chorus)
My wish, my sadness
I am still yours, you are still mine
Everything, everything is hurting (in the body) because of you
My wish, my sadness If I'm fortunate you will return
My punishment, my sin
Quietly, quietly tear, dont give in Refren (Chorus) Everything, everything is hurting (in the body) because of you
My wish, my sadness"
Européennes,"We feel like breaking free
When there's no more sun inside our houses
In the mood of flying away
A couple of hours on a plane to change everything
Amsterdam, Copenhagen or Capri
It's great to commit a thousand follies We are European women
And we find the things we love here
From London to Paris
Even if the music is broadcast
Live from Radio LA European woman, and for us, when we're in love
It's the French kind of love, sort of liberated
The old continent, we like it
With USA music in the background We all have in our hearts
A song that tells about the Indian Summer
Colourful posters
Of African sunsets We prefer the Italian smile
England, Boy George and Lady Di We are European women
And we find the things we love here
From London to Paris
Even if the music is broadcast
Live from Radio LA European woman, and for us, when we're in love
It's the French kind of love, sort of liberated
The old continent, we like it
With USA music in the background
Hey... We are European women
And we find the things we love here
From London to Paris
The weather is nice in California
But Saint Tropez is also good European women"
Romeo,"I remember the first time you asked me over
I was shy, but in the mood for love
Now the passion was to be tempted out
It was too late to get nervous I bought flowers and borrowed clothes
To show my true desire
But when I said 'welcome on board'
I got to hear a few well-chosen words: Romeo, Romeo, the gods shall know that you never will become a
Romeo, Romeo, try to take it easy I made attempts at seducing you
You asked for time to understand
My greatest pleasure was to touch you
My biggest stupidity was to feel you up I played the part of lover and joker
In the hope that we would become a couple
But when you saw that I expected more
I got to hear of a well-known partner Romeo, Romeo, the gods shall know that you never will become a
Romeo, Romeo, try to take it easy Romeo, Romeo, the gods shall know that you never will become a
Romeo, Romeo, try to take it easy And when I fell down on my knees and begged
You came towards me and said...
You said: Romeo, Romeo, the gods shall know that you never will become a
Romeo, Romeo, try to take it easy Romeo, Romeo, the gods shall know that you never will become a
Romeo, Romeo, try to take it easy

Runner in the Night,"Goin' home, I'm a runner in the night
Turnin' back with another chance to make it right
I know where I went wrong
I've been away for far too long
I'm on the track - I'm a runner in the night

You told me once not to go, I guess I wasn't listening
I was blind to reason then
You were the light guidin' me
Was so confused I could not see
Without your love I wasn't free

Goin' home, I'm a runner in the night
Turnin' back with another chance to make it right
I wanna start again
Go back in time till I get to when
I took your heart like a runner in the night

You didn't ask much of me
I didn't make you promises
You kept faith, I broke the rules
I'm sorry now, my mistake
I didn't mean that your heart should break
I want you back, what will it take?
Oh... oh...

I know I made you wait, I only hope it's not too late
To try again for a runner in the night

(Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin')
(Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin')
Yeah...

Goin' home, I'm a runner in the night, ooh...
Touchin' down on the runway with the mornin' flight
I know I made you wait
I only hope it's not too late
To try again for a runner in the night
(Runnin', runnin')

Goin' home, I'm a runner in the night, ooh...
Touchin' down on the runway with the mornin' flight
I know I made you wait
I only hope it's not too late"
Gleðibankinn,"Time passes quickly in an age of satellites.
Quicker each day, quicker each night.
Do you sometimes think about all the yellow tickets?
Perhaps you withdraw too much from the bank of happiness. Muster up your courage, tie everything into a knot.
You don't deposit anything, you only withdraw.
The sins you never committed sit in your thoughts.
An uncashed check in the bank of happiness. You should sing a little song about the joy of living that's inside of you
Let it be heard that you have a little house of happiness.
A cosy little song that could captivate me or anyone.
You don't deposit an empty blues into the bank of happiness. You should sing a little song about the joy of living that's inside of you
Let it be heard that you have a little house of happiness.
A cosy little song that could captivate me or anyone.

Alles heeft ritme,"Seven o’clock, you have to get out of your bed
Your mother is shouting from the corridor:
“Come on girl, how long is it going to take?”
Listen up, I’m only just dreaming
A quarter past seven, I still have all the time
Because getting up doesn’t take an eternity It always goes this way
You always try it again and again
In your own way, every time a little harder Take the time for everything
Live your own rhythm
You can make everything swing
In your own rhythm Rhythm is in all people
And you can learn how to swing
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everything has a rhythm The whole day you’ve been running again
Quarter past six, you’re not in time once again
Now, who whines about a futility like that? Oh, in time, I just can’t get used to it
Listen up, does it matter?
Because I’m going my own way anyway It always goes this way
You always try it again
In your own way, every time a little harder Take the time for everything

Valentino,"Valentino
In Madrid, in a hotel
It happened, I played my role
She and I, the passion
Coincided at the reception
Valentino couldn't have done it better
Red roses with an invitation
A tango in the lounge
Champagne and seduction
And the orchestra will play for the two of us
The passion will take us to your room
Valentino, Valentino
Attraction, emotion
She will fall under my control
Valentino, dance a tango for me
I want to be the hero in your films
Valentino couldn't have done it better
Red roses with an invitation
Lying on the chaise longue, waiting for my love
Ah, if Hollywood knew who I am
Everybody would dance to my song
Valentino, Valentino, Valentino"

Not for me, easy come and easy go
Not for me
Those tricks after evenings at the disco

I want a story that lasts a lifetime
I won't unfold my wings
For a one night stand
No that's not it
I want love, love the way it used to be
Tender feelings, that's what I want from you Not for me, all those extravagances
The parties, certain holidays
The follies that one regrets later in life Not for me
I don't trust those with experience
No thanks, all that was not really made for me I want a love written in capitals
I want a story that lasts a lifetime
I won't unfold my wings
For a one night stand
No, that's not it

You Can Count on Me,"I was so happy with you
My hopes and dreams had all come true
And our love shone for all the world to see
As if you turned out the light
Your love was gone overnight
And all I’ve left are words you said to me
You can count on me, you can count on me
Till the end of time, plus eternity
You can count on me, you can count on me
I’ll be by your side, you can count on me
I see despair all around
All of the world is upside down
And there’s no light ahead that I can see
If we could only be friends
Give it a chance and try again
Maybe we can relive the words you said to me
You can count on me, you can count on me
Till the end of time, plus eternity
You can count on me, you can count on me
I’ll be by your side, you can count on me
(You can count on, you can count on)
(Don’t you know you can count on me?)
I’ll be by your side, you can count on me
You can count on me (On me, don’t you know?)
You can count on me
Count on me till the end of time, plus eternity
You can count on me (On me, don’t you know?)
You can count on me
Count on me, I’ll be by your side, you can count on me"
J'aime la vie,"I see people bend their backs
As if life is worth nothing
Me, I’m fifteen and I’m telling you
Whoa whoa… I love life
(I love life- life, all of life)
I too, must believe
The flashes of hope, the sleeplessness
But sum-total, addition
I love the horizon, I love, I love life
(Even if it’s crazy)
I love, I love life
(Bravo for the challenge)
I love, I love life
Don’t blame me
I’m not like that
I love, I love life
Whoa… and nevermind
If it rains too much on me
Whoa whoa… you are
Before Jacques Brel, before Mozart
I feel small, I’m depressed
I am nothing but a speck of dust
In this universe
(That’s life, life, all of life)
But say that you love me, say that you smile
My joys enchant them for infinity
There’s no more Brel, no more Mozart
My life restarts
I love, I love life
(Even if it’s crazy)
I love, I love life
(Bravo for the challenge)
I love, I love life
Don’t blame me
I’m not like that
I love, I love life
Nevermind if it rains a bit much on me
I love, I love life

I love, I love life

I love, I love life
Don’t blame me
I’m not like that
I love, I love life

For the days that don’t
I have something
I count on you
I love, I love life
Whoa… and nevermind
If it rains a bit much on me
Whoa whoa… life- yes, you are"
Über die Brücke geh'n,"Talk is cheap, come on, let's go towards the light
They'll see us there - no, I'm not scared
Because your hand is giving me a feeling of trust
Let's get started and let's build a bridge, whoa-oh-oh Crossing the bridge, understading different people
Different songs, different countries on Earth
Crossing the bridge, looking behind the wall
Good thoughts will melt the ice inside the hearts all over our world We're guests here just for a while
On this planet full of light and darkness
It's also up to you and me what it will become one day
Open your heart and so the door will open as well, whoah-oh-oh Crossing the bridge, understading different people
Different songs, different countries on Earth
Crossing the bridge, looking behind the wall
Good thoughts will melt the ice inside the hearts all over our world Crossing the bridge, seeing the sun shining brighter
The morning shining brighter, our stars shining brighter
Crossing the bridge, seeing love shining brighter
Good thoughts will melt the ice inside the hearts all over our world
All over our only world"

Socrates, you, super star,
Athens that you loved so much
It gives you bitter poison.
A bitter dawn, the earth became an orphan
Socrates, you, super star
The time that you were beginning
To find the eternal God. God, god, god, god they don’t call you

Die Zeit ist einsam,"Time is lonely
Time is lonely and it is tired
It is tired of looking for you and stands still
Time is lonely and looks for us both
I alone cannot make it start again
For as long as you are not here
Time is so quiet
I am so like it
Time is lonely
I was always with you there
Time didn't know anything else
Always beaming eyes
It asks: Where is this light?
It asks: Where is the person
I used to be when I was with you?
It says, that I am alien to it
Why do I come alone to it
Time is lonely and it is tired
It is tired of looking for you and stands still
For as long as you're not here
It will not pass
I am so like it
Time is lonely"
E' de' det här du kallar kärlek?,"I cannot live normally anymore
Each day is different from the other
And I’ve been trying to ignore you totally
Even though I know you are unique
Emotions always burning are torment to me
And yet I still want you for me
Even though I suffer a longing for you
I ask and demand an answer
Is this what you call love? (This what you call love?)
I don’t want to have any more
Is this what you call feelings? (This what you call feelings?)
There’s no point to it
Everything you do is concentrated on me
You’ve become an obsession
It’s easy for me to be fascinated by you
You are loves irresistible force
Emotions always burning are torment to me
Yet I still want you for me
Even though I feel, I’m longing for you
I ask and demand an answer
Is this what you call love? (This what you call love?)
I don’t want to have any more
Is this what you call feelings? (This what you call feelings?)

I plead and I pray, but no wonder happens

Du er fuld af løgn,"Look, just like before
You stand there making eyes
Ooh, so confidently, to me
Standing there looking
As if it’s a game you’re playing
I say it honestly now, do you know what you are? You’re full of lies
When you say we’re just friends
I go along with the joke for a little longer And before 24 hours have passed
I think you’re lies will come to an end
For you strike sparks when you touch me You play up
And entertain your friends
That will stop the first time When you see, it’s the two of us
And you finally admit
That everything I say is true You’re full of lies
When you say we’re just friends
I go along with the joke for a little longer And before 24 hours have passed
I think you’re lies will come to an end
For you strike sparks when you touch me Just polish your halo, do a cool style
Tell a new story, you can do whatever you want For I can see that… (I can see that…)
You’re full of lies
Clear as an open book
So give me four days, just with you You’re full of lies
When you say we’re just friends
I go along with the joke for a little longer And before 24 hours have passed
I think you’re lies will come to an end
It’s so simple, you’re hot like me For you strike sparks when I touch you
It’s so simple, you’re hot for me"
Never the End (Päivä kahden ihmisen),"Over the mountains
Beyond the seas
My mind banishes the past
A little boy is a grown person
After he can create a new beginning I can't sleep
Till the next morning
I'm awake
And wondering why I can't find
I don't want a bigger world
Just one day
One tomorrow
I will never say the end The city lights
The echo of music
They stay in the foggy web
I have lost so much
I'm still looking for you
Like a world that has disappeared I can't sleep
Till the next morning
I'm awake
And wondering why I can't find
I don't want a bigger world
Just one day
One tomorrow
I will never say the end I can't sleep
Till the next morning
I'm awake
I can't find
I don't want a bigger world
Just one day
One tomorrow
I will never say the end"
Não sejas mau para mim,"The good side of life

I only want you, oh oh… A love story with ‘L’
I’m not counting on it, but I won’t forget it
The good side of being with you
Is kept in my senses The crazy tapes, the wet kisses
The short sentences, it’s all right
I want to dance, to enjoy, to embrace
The fire that’s burning inside of you Don’t be so angry with me, oh oh…
I only want you, oh oh…
Don’t be so angry with me, oh oh…
I only want you, oh oh… I don’t know if it’s a problem
To imagine that everything is possible
I have no idea how to change
The colour of infinity The sound of love, the magical kisses
The in and the out, it’s all right
Are you staying or are you going?
I’m not waiting to see you, should I or not? I only want you, oh oh…
Don’t be so angry with me, oh oh…
I only want you (Oh oh…)
Don’t be so angry with me

Mitt liv,"Now the limelight has been lit, a voice whispers anxiously
What have I to say?

Do I have enough to give?
I have to seize the chance now
But can I trust myself, my life? Now I'm standing in front of a road, only I can walk
A future in my hands
And a goal only I can catch
No one can take my dream away from me, it is my life I'm looking for answers
All the thoughts I have, make me doubt
But that won't stop me
I want to go my own way and I dare to say

Shir habatlanim (שיר הבטלנים),"Come on already, please Each morning I wake up at around ten
I want to see the sun, the shutters are blocking the view
I open the shutters and I can't see the sun
Because the sun is blocked by rows of buildings I make myself a cup of coffee and light a cigarette
I go out to the balcony to crack open some seeds
The birds come down to the plants of the balcony
And sing with me the bums' song Hupa hule hule hule… hupa hupa hule hule…
Hupa hule hule hupa pa…
Hupa hule hule… hupa hupa hule hule…
Hupa hule hule hupa pa… At around noon I send the dog
With a basket made of straw to buy me some groceries
When he comes back, I make us both lunch
Because the birds have eaten all the seeds Suddenly I heard a ring, someone's knocking at the door
I open the door, the neighbour comes in
She asks politely, if it's no bother
To sing with me my hupa'le Hupa hule hule hule… hupa hupa hule hule…
Hupa hule hule hupa pa…
Hupa hule hule… hupa hupa hule hule…
Hupa hule hule hupa pa… In the afternoon I go out with the dog
To get some air in the park on the city outskirts
The birds fly happily towards the sky
I lay back on the bench, thinking about life I'm living in such a wonderful reality
I'm swimming in a whirlpool of a sea with no worries
I don't understand how anyone can live differently nowadays
And I fall asleep, tired of all the thoughts Hupa…
Hupa hole… hole hupa…

Hægt og hljótt,"The evening has vanished way too fast
Outside the window, the night has come
Candles are burning up
Glasses are now more than empty Eyelids are like lead
Yet no one pretends to understand anything
And time took off its top hat
When the pianist hit the last note We disappear slowly and quietly, out in the warm night
Slowly and quietly, we walk down the street on our way home
Once, once more Remaining chairs, benches, tables
Broken glasses, words said and unsaid
Silence finally gets its peace
Birds compose a poem for the new dawn We disappear slowly and quietly, out in the warm night
Slowly and quietly, we walk on the street to home Slowly and quietly, we walk down the street on our way home
Slowly and quietly, through the warm night
Once, once more"
Soldiers of Love,"Liliane Saint-Pierre - Soldiers of love A new day, a new scandal
We see violence at the news
People use children in the fight
For ideals, for profit
We all feel guilty but we drink a gulp of wine
You non-stop ask yourself what we are doing* Love scares away disagreement
Cleans your soul, buries the fight
Just begin with yourself, slowly from the inside to the outside
Take each other's hands, forge those bands
Do you hear that distant cry
No human is asking for that pain Soldiers of love
Fire love
No more bullets
All weapons down
Fire love
The weapons down
No more war I had a dream in which i saw
The whole world with a flag
Upon which you could read in big
We want peace and no hate
United we stand, together we will fall
Lay down all weapons, no more war** Soldiers of love

Boogaloo,"If you feel that your day is grey, the earth will still turn
It doesn’t care that much of, who left and who came
Soon the sun will shine again, over a bed of flowers
Warm winds from the past, will play you an refrain
Boogaloo, dancing rock ‘n’ roll
Play cool music on your Walkman
Boogaloo, dancing rock ‘n’ roll
A smell of summer and romance Do you want to live and do you want to dance?
Dare to laugh and dare to take a chance?
Boogaloo, dancing rock ‘n’ roll
Play cool music on your Walkman La lalala lala lalala…
La lalala lala lala…
La lalala lala lalala…
La lalala lala lala… You that has been longing so much
You will reach all you ever longed for
Look forward and you will see, it will all soon happen
Down to the sea by train and car all of our gang is travelling
Warms summer winds will play our refrain Boogaloo, dancing rock ‘n’ roll
Play cool music on your Walkman
Boogaloo, dancing rock ‘n’ roll
A smell of summer and romance Do you want to live and do you want to dance?
Dare to laugh and dare to take a chance?
Boogaloo, dancing rock ‘n’ roll
Play cool music on your Walkman A song searching its way through
Gives us the warmth and a new harmony
It feels ok, don’t say no
Dare to dance and sing like us Boogaloo, dancing rock ‘n’ roll
Play cool music on your Walkman
Boogaloo, dancing rock ‘n’ roll
A smell of summer and romance Do you want to live and do you want to dance?
Dare to laugh and dare to take a chance?
Boogaloo, dancing rock ‘n’ roll
Play cool music on your Walkman La lalala lala lalala…
La lalala lala lala…
La lalala lala lalala…

Gente di mare,"(this song is about a man and the different feelings and stages of a relationship, it describes breaking up with his woman flippantly, being strong and sensitive yet totally weak when it comes to her sexual allure. Loving and hating her at the same time. A relationship that is dying but still they make love. It ultimately describes how he loses his mind  over her and the chorus is about desperately begging her to take him back. It also describes why a woman is so attractive and what he loves about her...He describes how they could live happily together which is part of his plea for her to forgive him) I love you
a coin in mid air
if it lands heads
it means that it's over (it's enough)
let's leave each other.. (we'll break up) (I love you)
Deep down I am not a cold hearted man
( I am not mean, I am a sensitive guy)
In bed I am in charge! (I command! I call the shots!)
BUT.... I tremble before your bosom I hate you and I love you in bed, the love we make
is like a butterfly dying
beating its wings
take my other half
(take all of me? be my other wing?) today i return to her (I'm coming back from being away or I'm crawling back to her..)
1st of May,
get up courage! I LOVE YOU
I ASK FOR FORGIVNESS
REMEMBER IT'S ME (remember who I am)
OPEN THE DOOR TO A SOLDIER MADE OF TISSUE PAPER
(A guy who acts tough but is as weak as piss) give me your light wine (summer wine)
that you made while I was gone
and give me linen sheets,
let me sleep in them like a child
who dreams of horses and spins around (a carousel)
and (give me) some work to do..
let me wrap my arms around a woman
who sings while she irons!
and then let yourself be teased a little
(let me tease you a little/ seduce you)
before we make love
dress (cover) your anger with peace (don't be angry anymore)
and the light with your petticoat
(let me see through your petticoat in the lamp light) I love you
i ask for forgiveness
remember its me
I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you"
Neste barco à vela,"In my country, there's a river
That keeps on flowing
In my country, there's a ship
That doesn't always reach the sea
In my country, they give sadness
The name of loneliness
In my country, beauty
Is invented in my hand

I'm sailing an empty boat
That crosses the river
To the pier of longing
I'm gliding on such a beautiful wave
In this sailing boat
That doesn't wear out

I'm sailing a crowded boat
With you in the middle
Of the path of hope
I'm gliding on such a beautiful wave
In this sailing boat
Looking a little childish

In my country, there's a river
That keeps on flowing
In my country, there's a ship
That doesn't always reach the sea
In my country, there's a sun
Of rage and flowers
Although it has dark eyes
That are waiting for me

I'm sailing a crowded boat
With you in the middle
Of the path of hope
I'm gliding on such a beautiful wave
In this sailing boat
Looking a little childish

I'm sailing a crowded boat
With you in the middle
Of the path of hope
I'm gliding on such a beautiful wave

Hey, can you hear me?
I am singing, singing What are you going to think?
Oh, what an hour to be calling
You can change
If you want to, I’ll come by to pick you up Now my city passes by behind the crystal2
One more stoplight to go
I am listening to the radio, I am listening to the radio
There is your main entrance, I am giving you a signal
You are already there Yes, you are there, like always, with no questions asked
The smile like another gesture – what are friends for?
Yes, you are there, and that is what matters to me
Once more you’ll tell me: what are friends for? Hey, you are not alone
Hey, you are loved
Hey, can you hear me?

And now we've gotta stop, don't
You're not the one I really want

Rechtop in de wind,"When the door slammed shut, a shudder moved here through this house
And the shiver went very deep into my heart
Oh, I was knocked out, almost exhausted myself
And the value of being happy was adjusted
And the clock constantly ticked the word ""over"" But upright in the wind
I'll keep standing
I'll walk through, just believe me
Either with or without you Upright in the wind
Even if it's a hurricane
If you can't find solid ground anymore
I'll still stand upright in the wind
(Upright in the wind) When the door slammed shut I told myself: ""Don't look back anymore""
Pull up the bridge, make a fortress of your heart
And keep your tears, save them for the night
When you're still hoping and waiting in the wild darkness
But that'll pass, that too will be over once But upright in the wind
I'll keep standing
I'll walk through, just believe me
Either with or without you Upright in the wind
Even if it's a hurricane
If you can't find solid ground anymore
I'll still stand upright in the wind If you can't find solid ground anymore
I'll still stand upright in the wind
(Upright in the wind) Upright in the wind

Strange lights
Won't let them blind me

Running on through my mind

Can't you see the light?
It's only the light
Only light

Mirrors
I see your reflection
Moving
In every direction
I can't see
It seems so confusing
So touch me
Remove this illusion

It's only the light
That glows in the night
The spirit that moves me
The spirit that moves free
It's only the light
After me

It's only the light
I can see the light
It's only the light
Can't you see the light?
It's only the light
Only light

Les mots d'amour n'ont pas de dimanche,"Quiet little girl
Tender little girl
She wants to be loved
By always saying ""I love you!""
Passion in the depth of her eyes
Blue as the sky
She is speaking very quietly
Listen to her

Words of love don't have a Sunday
Why would someone hold them back?
They come from the heart
Words of love don't have a Sunday
Magical music
For happiness

How I resemble her
And I shiver just liker her
I still want to dream
I still want to hope
Passion in the depth of her eyes
Blue as the sky
A little heat
No fear anymore

Words of love don't have a Sunday
Why would someone hold them back?
They come from the heart
Words of love don't have a Sunday
Magical music
For happiness

You have to say what you feel
Otherwise it wouldn't be easy
To understand you
Act like the child that doesn't cheat
When it loves, it stretches out its hand to you
So don't forget

Words of love don't have a Sunday
Why would someone hold them back?
They come from the heart
Words of love don't have a Sunday
Magical music
For happiness

Words of love don't have a Sunday
Magical music
For happiness"
Lass die Sonne in dein Herz,"Let the sun into your heart
Send your desires soaring into the sky
Grant a little bit of freedom to your dreams
Let the sun into your heart Sometimes you're sad and don't know why
A thousand small things make you fall silent
You've almost forgotten what it's like to be human
But you're not alone Let the sun into your heart
Send your desires soaring into the sky
Grant a little bit of freedom to your dreams
Let the sun into your heart Sometimes during those nights, your rage is blinding you
And emotions die like a candle in the wind
You're losing your courage as fear takes hold of you
But you're not alone Let the sun into your heart
Send your desires soaring into the sky
Grant a little bit of freedom to your dreams
Let the sun into your heart You got to believe in yourself, you don't need pity
You got to love your life, for you only have one
Never stand in the shadows again, step into the light
You are not alone Let the sun into your heart
Send your desires soaring into the sky
Step into the light with arms wide open
Let the sun into your heart Let the sun into your heart
Send your desires soaring into the sky
Grant a little bit of freedom to your dreams
Let the sun into your heart"

 And you said that you wanted me to wait for you
 Then you just vanished
 I look for something to bring us together
 But only a picture is left for me, yeah, oh… White, black, I dream you are coming back to me
 White, black, I play the piano and you smile
 And as I touch the key I feel like flying
 White, black, I dream I’ll see you again I see your face in the mirror
 As a star falls in the night
 A wish we’ll be together
 My dream always comes true
 With a song, a sweet ballad, yeah, oh… White, black, I dream you are coming back to me
 White, black, I play the piano and you smile
 And as I touch the key I feel like flying
 White, black, I dream I’ll see you again I close my eyes, I want to find myself by your side

Sata salamaa,"The white lands are getting darker
 Singing trees go silent
 Children of the streets go into hiding
 When a storm is rising Let’s fear our fears away
 Nothing could take me away
 When love sticks tightly to you
 And the heart gets warmer Though a hundred lightnings strike fire
 And all of life explodes
 Nobody can take love away from me
 There’s always hope When a hundred suns shine on us
 And a ship is ready to depart
 I will take our love to a safe place
 And we’ll find a new land I feel tenderness beside you
 A dream of an exhausted land
 From the wind of the night the last dream
 Gives us shelter I see the truth in your hope
 You create a flame by whispering
 Only love will take us there
 It saves us Though a hundred lightnings strike fire
 And all of life explodes
 Nobody can take love away from me
 There’s always hope When a hundred suns shine on us
 And a ship is ready to depart
 I will take our love to a safe place
 And we’ll find a new land There’s a thousand worlds out there
 And one of them is ours Though a hundred lightnings strike fire
 And all of life explodes
 I will take our love to a safe place
 And we’ll find a new land
I will take our love to a safe place
 I will change this land to another white land"
En lille melodi,"The earth is yours and mine
Ooh... the place we love
Take good care of it, that's a common matter It takes more, than just saying we know
Try with this song It was a little tune
We sing here
But just sing along and see what happens
Together we could be the biggest choir
A song can become more than you think No matter who we are
And no matter where we live
We've all borrowed the same earth
Ooh yeah... But remember, still
It always starts with yourself
Try once, ooh... with this song It was a little tune
An easy refrain
That can be sung over and over, ooh yeah... again
Together we could be the biggest choir
A song can become more than you think (Sing a song a be everybody's friend)
(Let us sing again)
(Sing a song about a better earth)
(It helps more than you think) It was a little tune
An easy refrain
That can be sung over and over, ooh yeah... again
Together we could be the biggest choir
A song can become more than you think"
Hold Me Now,"Don’t don’t close your heart to how you feel
Dream and don’t be afraid the dream’s not real

Make believe this moment’s here to stay

Touch touch me the way you used to do
I know tonight could be all I’ll have with you
From now on you’ll be with someone else instead of me
So tonight let’s build this memory for the last time

Hold me now don’t cry don’t say a word just
Hold me now and I will know though we’re apart
We’ll always be together forever in love
What do you say when words are not enough

Time time will be kind once we’re apart and
Your tears tears will have no place in your heart I wish
I I could say how much I’ll miss you, when you’re gone
All my love for you will go on and on and

Hold me now don’t cry don’t say a word just
Hold me now and try to understand
That I hope at last you’ve found what you’ve been searching for
And though I won’t be there anymore I will always love you
(Hold me now don’t cry)

Don’t say a word just hold me now and I will know though
We’re apart we’ll always be together forever in love
What do you say when words are not enough
What can I say now my words are not enough"

"Moitié, moitié","The world is a swing forbidden to children

At the bottom it is the tears of eyes

Relentless and stupid
And it fills itself on one side and empties itself more on the other
At the bottom it is full to breaking point
At the top nothing left to give
So many things to change, necessary to be half-and-half Love it's half and half
Always do half-and-half
Happiness that we share put the misfortune in a cage Love it's half and half
Always do half-and-half
All the good that we give
It's the bad that imprisons us But somewhere a plane of madmen crashed in the middle of the desert
And it's the book of life that becomes dust again
The angel of chance has struck
The genie has flown away
His message has stayed, we are going to do half -and-half Love it's half and half
Always do half-and-half
Happiness that we share put the misfortune in a cage Love it's half and half
Always do half-and-half

Give me life, where everything is born again Then when everything changes and time doesn't exist anymore

Ben adam (בן אדם),"A human being is only flesh and blood
Dust flying in the desert
A human being, in the way of the world
Like a passing shadow, like broken pottery A man is just a man and most of his days are nights
And no man is perfect in all virtues
So let him dream and give him breath
Give to Shem, give to Ham, give to Japheth comfort Don’t burden him and give him hope
And don’t always judge him for the worse
For a man is a man, is a man, is just a man A human being awakens and already falls asleep
His days are short, their end is sad
A human being is a guest in the world
He came from ashes and to ashes he will return A man is just a man and most of his days are nights
And no man is perfect in all virtues
So let him dream and give him breath
Give to Shem, give to Ham, give to Japheth comfort Don’t burden him and give him hope
And don’t always judge him for the worse
For a man is a man, is a man, is just a man He won’t learn forever
He forgets to love
He doesn’t know that his day is near Because a man is just a man and most of his days are nights
And no man is perfect in all virtues
So let him dream and give him breath
Give to Shem, give to Ham, give to Japheth comfort Don’t burden him and give him hope
And don’t always judge him for the worse
For a man is a man, is a man, is just a man A man is just a man and most of his days are nights
And no man is perfect in all virtues
So let him dream and give him breath
Give to Shem, give to Ham, give to Japheth comfort Don’t burden him and give him hope
And don’t always judge him for the worse
For a man is a man, is a man, is just a man"
Ne partez pas sans moi,"You who seek the star
You who live a dream
You, heroes in the space
In the heart, bigger than the earth
Give me the chance
Take me far from here Do not leave without me
Let me follow
You who fly to other cities
Let me live
The most beautiful adventure
The most beautiful journey
Which leads one day
To suns
To the planets of love You the new poets
You the magic birds
You, you might find
New music
You, give me a chance
I want to sing along Do not leave without me
Let me follow
You who fly to other cities
Let me live
Blue of infinity
The joy of being free
On rays, on suns On songs, on wonders
And in sky of love
Blue of infinity
The joy of being free
You who seek these other lives
You who fly towards the year 2000
Do not leave without me"
Take Him Home,"So much to do, so little time
You ask me, can I change the world?
And then, for everybody’s sake
What are the changes I would make?
And you can dream, dream on, my friend
You have the right
There is something we can do
Something we can do, it’s so easy
If I light a candle for everybody I know
I could see forever down that long, long road
So if you meet somebody, it might be someone I know
Brother, if he needs you, take him home
You can look him in the eye and hold out your hand
Tell him you’re a brother and he’ll understand
So if you meet somebody, it might be someone I know
Brother, if he needs you
Brother, if he needs you, take him home
So if you meet somebody, it might be someone I know
Brother, if he needs you
Brother, if he needs you
Brother, if he needs you, take him home
Brother, if he needs you, take him home"
Lied für einen Freund,"Here's a song for you
Just listen
For this melody
Is just like you - listen
It's honest and straightforward
Tender and wise
Happy and quiet at the same time
And it's strong enough Because you are that way
Just like this song for a friend
A song just like you
Just like the way you live and dream If you hear it anywhere:
I miss you so much Friends never leave early
They never disappoint you
Friends will stay with you when all the others leave
They share happiness and sorrow, too This song is for you
It's not much
But once this song fades out
A feeling will remain Because you are that way
Just like this song for a friend
A song just like you
Just like the way you live and dream If you hear it anywhere:
I miss you so much"
Lisa Mona Lisa,"She sleeps during the day and dances at night
I hear her crying when she laughs
And she laughs again and again
She sees clearly at night and needs no light
She paints fairy tales on her face
And she laughs me down
Sometime I learn to see her
Sometime I begin
Can I look behind her colours?
(Lisa, Mona Lisa)
(Lisa, Mona Lisa)
She’s lying but no liar
She carries her life in her face, and she lives
Somehow it’s very difficult to see her
Somehow I’m glad
To sometimes understand her dreams
Lisa, Mona Lisa
Lisa, Mona Lisa
Lisa, Mona Lisa
Lisa, Mona Lisa
She’s tumbling through the glittering town
Searching for someone, who has a smile for her
Somehow
Somehow I like her
And somehow I love her
And somehow I will understand her
Whoa…
Lisa, Mona Lisa
Lisa, Mona Lisa
Lisa, Mona Lisa
Lisa, Mona Lisa
Lisa, oh, Mona Lisa
Lisa (Mona Lisa)
"
Ka' du se hva' jeg sa'?,"Like a bird on the wire,
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free. Like a worm on a hook,
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee. If I, if I have been unkind,
I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you. Like a baby, stillborn,
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me. But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee. I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
He said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,
She cried to me, ""Hey, why not ask for more?"" Oh like a bird on the wire,
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
have tried in my way to be free. Ladida..."
Kloun (Κλόουν),"A circus sells joy again in the night
And as a first act the clown portrays life
Crews, noise, everyone here lives in a fever of activity
Lights and music, time becomes just a moment
Clown, clown I am the clown
Clown, clown I am the clown
Ha ha ha ha…
Clown, clown I am the clown
Clown, clown I am the clown
Ha ha ha ha…
I sing, laugh, cry and babble
I do somersaults, I imitate you if you like
People laugh at everything I do, they all applaud me
But even the children know, that I have a heart
Clown, clown I am the clown
Clown, clown I am the clown
Ha ha ha ha…
Clown, clown I am the clown
Clown, clown I am the clown
Ha ha ha ha…
And when there will come a time that I’ll be without an audience
I’ll always laugh, crying I’ll sing
Clown, clown I am the clown
Clown, clown I am the clown
Ha ha ha ha…
Clown, clown I am the clown
Clown, clown I am the clown

For vår jord,"Nobody knows who she is
Nobody dares to get too close
To where she's standing, crying out loud
With large eyes that never meet ours
She's looking into forgotten lands
One believes she's out of her mind She's one of those who stand guard by the flame (for our Earth)
One of those who keep the branches of the trees together (for our Earth)
She realises that the Earth is our mother – stand guard for our Earth! All people are looking in different directions
The idle talk is falling silent, we're exchanging glances and we're smiling
Her cry is down to the bone
She's bringing us message from the Earth She's one of those who stand guard by the flame (for our Earth)
One of those who keep the branches of the trees together (for our Earth) She's one of those who struggles in the current (for our Earth)
One of those who never wake up from the dream (for our Earth)
She realises that the Earth is our mother
(Stand guard) and keep the flame burning
(Stand guard) no matter what will happen
(Stand guard) stand guard for our Earth"
Laissez briller le soleil,"Let the sun shine
Ooh... billions of humans on earth
Search the light
To burn fierce fires
Ooh... their ideas, which are murdered
In camps, in mines
To imprison the sun
Ooh... I know that it hurts
Ooh... you see everything isn't normal
Ooh... in the streets and in the stations
The bottom of despair
Of those who are cold in the winter
Ooh... and all those toddlers that are mutilated
For begging the useless
What do they think of the sun?
Ooh... I know that it hurts
Ooh... you see everything isn't normal
Ooh... what will we do with the earth
When only stones are left
To be launched into the universe?
Ooh... if our fatal madness
Could finally be kept silent
Let the sun shine
Whoa... the sun
Let the sun shine
(Yes, the sun)
Let the sun shine
(Yes, the sun)
Let the sun shine"
Croire,"No, I don't want to sing about words that cry
Like the dark cry of a violin
Us, we see life with the heart's eyes
Nothing will keep us from believing Believing in the new world we have in our head
Believing in us to change tomorrow
Even believing in lies if that stops them
Believing in the lines of our hands Believing in the sky flooded with birds
Still believing in the space of your arms
Believing in the color of your skin
Believing that we'll walk more with every step Believing in time when we're 20 years old
Believing we can build on volcanic ground
Believing we can yell into the fire
When we have love in us"
Vivo (Ti scrivo),"Forgive me if I'm writing to you
But, you know, with words
It's not always easy
To say what you want Maybe because of shyness
Maybe because of the fear to sense
Too clearly
What makes us suffer Forgive me if I'm writing to you
We haven't heard each other anymore
In order not to risk
Finding each other hurt Who knows how many times
Without even realizing
We must have walked
A few meters from each other in the city Forgive me if I'm writing to you
But what's left to me now
A fist of memories
A photo with your name Written in the snow
While you're looking at the lens
And with your eyes you smile at me
And make me feel alive
I live, I live, I live, I live, I live
Even without you
And I'll find a reason
To keep living
Living Forgive me if I'm writing to you
But there's no poem
Explaining I love you
On your phone answering machine I may have stayed behind
But what I have in my heart
I don't want it to be deleted
From a tape Forgive me if I'm writing to you
But tell me what's left to me
Talking about memories
And playing with your name Written on a wall
Without even a good reason
It's just that screaming it
Makes me feel alive
I live, I live, I live, I live, I live
Even without you
And I'll find a reason
To keep living
Living, living"
Chanteur de charme,"There's a need to listen to
Tender schoolboy songs
Words dancing on paper There's a need to believe
All those cheap stories
That rhyme badly but make you feel good Nothing has ever kept them from being transferred into music
Those simple feelings, romantic clichés Crooner
It's beautiful, it's big, it's wonderful
Crooner, crooner Autumn road
Summer passions, colours of the time
Winter sun, spring rain The story of mankind
The kings, the jesters, the conquerers
Looking for Sleeping Beauty Well, pianos, moonshine strolling around in prose
And my heart on the front page offering itself foollishly Crooner
It's beautiful, it's big, it's wonderful
Crooner, crooner In the commotion
Of our cities I make a vow
Crooner, crooner Crooner, crooner"
Voltarei,"(I'll come back to you, I'll wait for you)
(I'll love you like this)
Will you come back to me?
I'll wait for you, I'll suffer for you
I'll come back for you
Let's play the game until the end Let's begin like this
Now it's my turn
I'm standing here and you can't see
Because you've gone blind I pretended I had another love
To replace you
Now you're winning by two to...
One without you
I lost you because I loved you like this
The one who laughs the most, cries in the end The game is over, the night has gone by
Who lost or who won, I've already forgotten
Ah! Cat and mouse game, love is like the sea
With tides that come and go and... I'll come back to you, I'll come back to you
I'll wait for you
Will you come back to me?
(I'll wait for you) I'll suffer for you
I'll come back to you
The one who laughs the most, cries in the end I'll come back to you"
Mangup,"I'm following you by days, i know everything about you
but you pass by me, and not even look at me
and I would give anything, all my years
if you just touch me for a moment, hold me for a moment But you are silly boy, a big silly boy
and you don't want a child like I am
But you are silly boy, a big silly boy
and you don't want a child like I am I'm following you by days, standing in front of you
but you are passing trought me like i don't even exist
and I would give anything, all my years
if you just touch me for a moment, hold me for a moment"
Avrei voluto,"I would’ve wanted to talk to you
To convince you you’d better be serious
You, who played with my heart and with your words
So much wasted time, trying to explain you
That I really loved you
We didn’t found each other, we didn’t look for each other
We were never lost, lost
I would’ve wanted to look at you
And intuit all your desires
Give you a sigh, if only from a distance
Because I was afraid you could see it
Like a lamp in your eyes, a sincere love
The anger wraps itself like a paper plane
When it meets the wall
I would’ve wanted more
I would’ve wanted you too
I would’ve wanted to tie you
To be able to look at you every day
To change the route, the road of our destiny
And stick you to my breast, so that I don’t let you go
To a life which flies away
The heart stops for a while
In those winter days and the ice will melt
And the ice will melt
And the ice will melt
I would’ve wanted to follow you
But pride is never fast
It’s just a pretext to cover a mistake
Even when I found out that it was our tomorrow
That wanted to conclude peace
The wrinkle on my face that you called ‘expression’
Is now the soil of a river
How many nights to think?
How many bitter tears have wet my soul?
I would’ve wanted more
I would’ve wanted more
I would’ve wanted more
I would’ve wanted you too

And not until the sun says good morning and gets a grip we'll say goodnight Those glasses you're wearing can colour in what's happening
Then you won't notice the joy others see
But you can borrow mine for a couple of hours if you'd like
Take a look around, open your eyes, jump out, and make a move We'll paint the city red and the sky white with starshine
What's grey and sad will get some extra paint
Then we'll give the night clothes a brush stroke, preferably more
And not until the sun says good morning and gets a grip we'll say goodnight Are still sitting in there?
Rolling the curtains down?
You'll have to find the joys

For this reason it’s good to be a dreamer I’m singing just a song tonight
A song to make friends
I’m singing just a song and I know
That with every word the ice breaks So that nobody will have to standing alone in the darkness
And love returns to the earth
To let every human being live in freedom
And turn guns into flowers sometime
For this reason it’s good to be a dreamer I’m singing just a song tonight
A song to make friends
I’m singing just a song and I know
That with every word the ice breaks I’m singing just a song tonight
A song that does like fire
I’m singing it for you and me
And for the whole world"
La dolce vita,"The good life
The last chord of my childhood's song
Keeps on playing in the horizon
I won't see the figure of the angel painting
By my side to protect me anymore
Yet over a thousand winds
I can hear a carefree song playing
And with it can sing a happy one:
The child of summer and sun
The good life
It has all been so sweet
The good life
No need for tears
I was just quenching life's thirst
I knew how to plead for happiness
After everything all I can say is:
The good life
Sometimes my mind is filled
With yearning to be with the white angels
When the rainbow bends in the sky
And I can't find my way to the bottom of it
But when the ribbon of the moments goes on
There's an unbroken peace in the soul
And to you can sing a happy one:
The child of summer and sun
The good life
It has all been so sweet
The good life
No need for tears
I was just quenching life's thirst
I knew how to plead for happiness
After everything all I can say is:
The good life
The good life
It has all been so sweet
The good life
No need for tears
I was just quenching life's thirst
I knew how to plead for happiness
After everything all I can say is:
The good life
The good life"
J'ai volé la vie,"I couldn't tell you my age
I wouldn't know how to write my name
I grew up like a stinging nettle
On tarry barks I don't know where the images come from
That are glued to my eyes
Nor from where this angry urge arises
To sing what I want to I purloined life - yes, I admit it
I don't remember from whom or where
I escaped thumbing my nose
At the vanities I purloined life without any regret
From two shadows passing by
But I kept my ray of sun I don't know whom I ressemble
I don't know towards whom I walk away
But from my castles of ashes
I can feel the fire coming to life again I feel my eyes are lighting up
May someone send me away from the day
May I reach the border
That separates me from love I purloined life - yes, I admit it
I don't remember from whom or where
I escaped thumbing my nose
At the vanities I purloined life without any regret
From two shadows passing by
But I kept my ray of sun I purloined life - yes, I admit it
I don't remember from whom or where
I escaped thumbing my nose
At the vanities I purloined life without any regret
From two shadows passing by
But I kept my ray of sun"
Nacida para amar,"Be silent, kiss me
Make me believe that everything remains the same
Close your eyes, please
Give me one more night Be silent, love me
Give me time until dawn
If I can't make you happy
Don't tell me now Born to love
I'd like to join your way
And to walk to your destiny
To kiss your footprints
To love your sign
Born to love I already know, it's already late
Thank you for this body-to-body
If I don't see you again, my love
Thank you for all your kisses Born to love
I'd like to join your way
And to walk to your destiny
To kiss your footprints
To love your sign
Born to love Born to love
I'm carrying spring in my skin
And the full moon in my caresses
And much more love than I wanted
Born to love"

To diko sou asteri (Το δικό σου αστέρι),"There are moments that fear and doubt win you
The world seems hostile and the night impassable and cold But in the evening sky, search and find your own star

Það sem enginn sér,"What no one sees
Light up my path, lustful old moon

That glows like gold in the light from the moon
Look back into my eyes
Look back, I wait for you
Look back into my eyes
And you can see what no one sees
Everyone desires something they keep to themselves
I intend if I may, to have a secret with you

Flieger,"Flyers
You and me, we flew so high
It was not a long time ago
An airplane full of young dreams
Was ready for us
The two of us, it was so great
We conquered the sky
Why did you let me go
Without a parachute in the night?
I've never totally forgotten the time
When we were flyers
You haven't left my heart
I only think about it
You've often told me: ""We're strong, both of us""
Something like that couldn't pass away like this
I've never totally forgotten the time
When we were flyers
I would like to do it again with you
Such a flight into the evening glow
I would like to risk my heart once again
Even if it killed me
The two of us, it was so great
Something like this is rare
Will we once again
Lose ourselves in the clouds?
I've never totally forgotten the time
When we were flyers
You haven't left my heart
I only think about it
You've often told me: ""We're strong, both of us""
Something like that couldn't pass away like this
I've never totally forgotten the time
When we were flyers
You haven't left my heart

Bandido,"The moon bewitched me and led me to you
I drank happily the poison of love
Even though it burned my chest and my skin
It tasted sweet like honey Your eyes, bandit, stole with lies the blood
 and the life of my heart
Your absence in my nights causes sadness
Sighs and tears, and dark passion And now when every time you leave my side
I feel that the pain grows more and more Your eyes, bandit, stole with lies the blood
 and the life of my heart
Your absence in my nights causes sadness
Sighs and tears, and dark passion Hold me with fury of a hurricane
The fire of your love is like a volcano
And then kiss me, catch me in your net
And at last your lips quenches my thirst Your eyes, bandit, stole with lies the blood
 and the life of my heart
Your absence in my nights causes sadness
Sighs and tears, and dark passion Your eyes, bandit, stole with lies the blood
 and the life of my heart
Your absence in my nights causes sadness
Sighs and tears, and dark passion"
Horis skopo (Χωρίς σκοπό),"Every night that I dance
Juggling in shadows and dark
I look for you between the stars
I search for you in the music of the street If only I could steal your dream
Lose myself in your fever
When you say I love you
And when you leave without a cause So many wounded streets
So many doors wthout people and light
You must be lost somewhere
Lost even in yourself If only I could steal your dream
Lose myself in your fever
When you say I love you
And when you leave without a cause If you could dream the day that daws in silence
Then you would be strong, you would see the sun
But i know you will cry, but... I will steal your dream
I will lose myself in your fever
When you say I love you
And when you leave without a cause"
Macédomienne,"When she cries, it’s the whole Adriatic
Which floods her eyes
When she sleeps, it’s not far from Ohrid
She dreams on the edge of beautiful blue lakes
I see her again, a little girl
On bare feet with rain in her hair
In her house, on the earthen floor
She has left the illusions of all her games Which she wants to keep to herself
She has the charm of Macedonian women
It’s vital that I love her, that I hold her
Whatever you may do or think But she is more beautiful
Those who don’t believe me let them come
They will see how much I have and that she is mine
You can shout, you can cry, you can laugh
But certainly not at her When she sleeps, it’s at the bottom of the hill
That she does with my body what she wants to
It’s a sunflower that is emigrated into the vines
With a heart of stone, and making flames of a fire A gipsy cry hidden in her murmurs
She lives love without denial
When she fights from the top of her wounds
She pretends everything, she mocks the gods Too many desire her
She has the charm of Macedonian women
It’s vital that I love her, that I hold her
Whatever you may do or think But she is more beautiful
Those who don’t believe me let them come
They will see how much I have and that she is mine
You can shout, you can cry, you can laugh
But certainly not at her"

Ik wil alles met je delen,"You are not the only one
 Who’s feeling lost

 Than I had meant them I meant everything I said
 I also learned
 To fight for a new day
 Is that wrong then? I want to share everything with you
 Want to be everything for you
 And if you want to trust me
 Then we’ll share the pain Crying together
 Getting crazy together
 Losing our head together
 Nothing is too crazy for me Life is a merry-go-round
 Life is a street
 That comes to a dead end once
 When you don’t know anymore where to go A moment, yes just a moment
 You think: it’s over
 But I love you the way you are
 Do you love me too? I want to share everything with you
 Want to be everything for you
 And if you want to trust me
 Then we’ll share the pain Crying together
 Getting crazy together
 Losing our head together
 And nothing is too crazy for me When I see the light on the horizon
 I still remember how it was
 How it once started I want to share everything with you
 I want to be everything for you Crying together
 Getting crazy together
 Losing our head together
 Nothing is too crazy for me"
Quand je te rêve,"When I dream of you
I see you right at the top of the towers
In the buildings of Singapore
Under a bit of rain in Cherbourg
In the gardens of Luxembourg
Always far away
A flight of birds over Manhattan
Come back to tell me that you're going away
I draw our love as your absences pass by
And it is like a summer that is beginning
When I dream of you, there are no more hours, no more distance
Nothing is important anymore, I forget all my states of urgency
When I dream of you, you take me, you lift me up
A smile on your lips and I'm afraid of the day which is dawning
When I dream of you, when I dream of you
You wait for me on the bench of a square
In all the rooms of the air terminals
I see you at the back of all the looks
Behind the blue glass of the mirrors
I guess your face in all the transparency
The journeys which I make in silence
When I dream of you, there are no more hours, no more distance
Nothing is important anymore, I forget all my states of urgency
When I dream of you, it's like a wind which takes me away
Which gives me a fever, come before the night comes to an end
Come into my dream, come into my dream
Come into my dream, come into my dream
Come into my dream, into my dream, into my dream
Come into my dream, into my dream, into my dream
Come into my dream
Oh... come into my dream
Come into my dream, into my dream, into my dream
Come into my dream, into my dream, into my dream"
Give a Little Love Back to the World,"We've come so far on this great planet
We should be proud of all the great things we've achieved
But in our search for life's great knowledge
We go on takin' out and never plant new seeds

Give a little love back to the world
We can't go on takin' out forever
Give a little love back to the world
We still got time, let's do it together
Give a little love back to the world

We've got to stop, think of tomorrow
One day our children may have nothing left to share
Let's do it now, then in the future
They will look back at us with pride and know we cared

Give a little love back to the world
We can't go on takin' out forever
Give a little love back to the world
We still got time, let's do it together

We got no time to hesitate
Tomorrow it may be too late

Give a little love back to the world

We still got time, we can do it together

Eitt lag enn,"With you – I become as I should be
Completely wild, I match your rhythm, you seduce me
I go – by what the eye sees
When I want something I demand, I become dangerous One more song, a real swing and here
Nobody tires, you must dance until the end
One more beat! Tones to play with
That which charms me and strikes my heart With me – there's no question
When we meet each other, I conjure a brew
A lot of fun comes with you
So I somehow turn wild, I turn crazy One more song, a real swing and here
Nobody tires, you must dance until the end
One more beat! Tones to play with
That which charms me and strikes my heart In your arms, I am free, we'll go anywhere
Let's let the magic of life take all control One more song, a real swing and here
Nobody tires, you must dance until the end
One more beat! The game is only about
Us continuing faster, and never hesitating That we continue, faster now
Never hesitate, me and you, – with anything"
Brandenburger Tor,"A whole world was there
To share what happened this autumn
We saw people cry with joy
And a border open towards the East
Nobody could elude it, all the people were there together
And got to see the Brandenburg Gate Here we are at the Brandenburg Gate
Hand in hand as if it were yesterday
You and I at the Brandenburg Gate
We see the Brandenburg Gate
Yes, we see the Brandenburg Gate A whole nation wanted to live
And tell about its rich culture
We saw the naked truth on TV
From a township behind a wall
The town lifted its veil, everything seems like before
To us at the Brandenburg Gate Here we are at the Brandenburg Gate
Hand in hand as if it were yesterday
You and I at the Brandenburg Gate
We see the Brandenburg Gate After many long years
It's a new spring for the Brandenburg Gate Here we are at the Brandenburg Gate
Hand in hand as if it were yesterday
You and I at the Brandenburg Gate
We see the Brandenburg Gate (Here we are at the Brandenburg Gate)
Hand in hand as if it were yesterday
You and I at the Brandenburg Gate
We see the Brandenburg Gate (Here we are at the Brandenburg Gate)
Hand in hand as if it were yesterday
You and I at the Brandenburg Gate
We see the Brandenburg Gate"
Shara barkhovot (שרה ברחובות),"Early in the morning
You were sleeping silently and softly
I covered myself in the coat
Not wanting to look
I left everything in its place
And the keys
In the box, as always
Look at me – singing in the streets
Gathering loves
Avoiding miracles and disappointments
Singing in the streets
Because I wanted to give up
To not be with you anymore
I wasn’t thinking about what is or isn’t worthwhile
And you, who are all my life
Will remain like a salt inscription on my hands
This morning
Has the taste of strange freedom
Like of death or a blessing
Because I went away from you
Look at me – singing in the streets
Gathering loves
Avoiding miracles and disappointments
Singing in the streets
And the great waters that you had been for me
Have gone far away and don’t come to me anymore
And you, who are all my life
Will remain a salt inscription on my hands
Oh, look at me
Look at me and the great waters
Have gone far away and don’t come to me anymore
And you, who are all my life
Will remain like a salt inscription on my hands
Ooh… ooh…
And I went away from you
And I went away from you

Hallo hallo,"I'm looking at my watch, you must be home by now
So I'm running down the stairs to call you
But down there in the box, someone with coins is up front
He's taking more out of his pocket while he's shrugging at me Then it's free, I'm dialling and I'm getting a hold
But it's just your machine that's answering I'm saying: Hello, hello, I do know that you're home
Can't you pick up your phone?
Hello, hello, I'm listening to your voice
But once the tape runs out, no one is ever there The townhall clock is ringing and now I'm standing here in the cold
I'm tired of clever show-off kind of guys
I've got a cold, I'm blowing my nose, walking about, sneezing
And I'm about to explode I'm grabbing the receiver, but once again I'm being fooled
For it's your stupid machine that's answering I'm saying: Hello, hello, I do know that you're home
Can't you pick up your phone?
Hello, hello, I'm listening to your voice
But once the tape runs out, no one is ever there I'm feeding the box with the last coin I've got
It'll always be your machine that answers I'm saying: Hello, hello, I do know that you're home
Can't you pick up your phone?
Hello, hello, I'm listening to your voice
But once the tape runs out, no one is ever there I'm saying: Hello, hello, I do know that you're home
Can't you pick up your phone?
Hello, hello, I'm listening to your voice
But once the tape runs out, no one is ever there
It would be great if you were able to pick up your phone"
Musik klingt in die Welt hinaus,"She was alone and nobody wanted her
I looked at her and I was in love with her right away
She became mine, it was my best time

Music that everyone can feel Music sounds out into the world
Music played by my violin
Music makes quite a few fairytales come true
Such wonderful music She plays in a major key when she's kissed by the muse
And in a minor key as well when she feels like crying
I remain loyal to her, I don't ever want to lose her
I want to stand by her, she's a part of me Music sounds out into the world
Music that is played by my violin
Music can be heard in every house
Music that everyone can feel Music sounds out into the world

White and Black Blues,"When one talks to me about skin color
I have the blues that send chills up my spine.
I feel like I'm in a tale of Edgar Allen Poe
Its the never more, the sound level at zero White and black
Dance, balance on the white and black blues.
Us, the blacks
We are a few million, 13 per dozen
Parasidical
Africa, my love, I have you in my skin.
White and black.
Who cares about color? All equal. Do you hear the beating of the drums?
They make you right in the heart, and pierce your soul
Like the arrow of a hunter, explorer.
A knife blade where tears glisten. White and black
Dance, balance on the white and black blues.
Us, the blacks
We are a few million, 13 per dozen
The length of the river,
Under the sun, the amber of the wetlands.
Where it rains
On our loves, taking the place of the storm. White and black
Dance, balance on the white and black blues.

Who still doesn't have as much as we do
Always, there's always someone
In the corner of the world who also dreams
Life was running in front of us
No colours and harmony
A step was a wall that silenced the voice
And truth meant nothing
How many moments did we lose?
Afraid of life, the dream was in vain, aha...
Always, there's always someone
Who still doesn't have as much as we do
Always, there's always someone
In the corner of the world who also dreams
The voices of the wind and the waves of the sea
Brought this new day
Now we came without having to dream
Moments of mad joy
Let's sing together without looking backwards
Nothing can stop love and peace
Always, there's always someone
Who still doesn't have as much as we do
Always, there's always someone
In the corner of the world who also dreams

Who still doesn't have as much as we do

Always, there's always someone"
Somewhere in Europe,"It's been a long time since we were together
I'm back in Ireland and I miss you more than ever
In early spring we parted and I've been here since then
But if I could only see you once again

Meet me in Paris on a Champs-Élysées night
We could be in Rome again, 'neath the Trevi fountain light
We should be together, and maybe we just might
If you could only meet me somewhere in Europe tonight

I remember Amsterdam as we sailed along the canal
And as the leaves began to fall, we were walking in old Bruxelles
In the Black Forest on a German summer's day
And the memories refuse to go away

Meet me in Paris on a Champs-Élysées night
We could be in Rome again, 'neath the Trevi fountain light
We should be together, and maybe we just might
If you could only meet me somewhere in Europe

Don't you remember those Adriatic days?
I miss your laughter and all your little ways
I can still see you in London, walking on Trafalgar Square
And drinking wine in Old Seville, how I wish that we were there

Meet me in Paris on a Champs-Élysées night
We could be in Rome again, 'neath the Trevi fountain light
We should be together, maybe we just might
If you could only meet me somewhere in Europe tonight

Meet me in Paris on a Champs-Élysées night
We could be in Rome again, 'neath the Trevi fountain light
We should be together, and maybe we just might
If you could only meet me somewhere in Europe tonight

Somewhere in Europe tonight
Somewhere in Europe"
Som en vind,"Out of a dream and into my heart
A feeling came and filled my soul
And I am a man travelling in his thoughts
Full of visions from a dream
And I feel... As if a wind were sweeping inside of me
Giving me warmth – come closer to me
Show me the way like a wind
Touch me like a wind Together, but far apart from each other
We know that we want to and that we can
One thought is worth a thousand words
And yet I don't know what I shall believe
But I feel... As if a wind were sweeping inside of me
Giving me warmth – come closer to me
Show me the way like a wind
Touch me like a wind I am a man full of visions
Stay and touch me Like a wind sweeping inside of me
Giving me warmth – come closer to me
Show me the way like a wind
Come to me, stay, don't turn away from me
Touch me like a wind Touch me like a wind"
Insieme: 1992,"With you, so far and different
With you, a friend that I thought I’d lost
You and I, having the same dream
Together, unite, unite, Europe And for you, a woman without borders
With you, under the same flags
You and I, under the same sky
Together, unite, unite, Europe We’re more and more free
It’s no longer a dream and you’re no longer alone
We’re higher and higher
Give me your hand, so that we can fly
Europe is not far away
This is an Italian song for you
Together, unite, unite, Europe For us, in heaven a thousand violins
For us, love without borders
You and I, having the same ideals, mmm…
Together, unite, unite, Europe We’re more and more free
It’s no longer a dream and we’re no longer alone
We’re uniting more and more
Give me your hand and you will see you’re flying
Europe is not far away
This is an Italian song for you
Together, unite, unite, Europe We’re more and more free
(More and more free)
Our stars, one single flag
We’re stronger and stronger
(Stronger and stronger)
Give me your hand and you will see yourself flying
Europe is not far away
This is an Italian song for you
Together, unite, unite, Europe Europe is not far away
This is an Italian song for you
Together, unite, unite, Europe"
Keine Mauern mehr,"Same time last year
noone would have thought
that our dream of freedom
took a step forward
The present starts right
she has it to be - at all costs
more colourful - not just black and white
'Cause our future starts right now
many languages, many ears no walls anymore
no walls anywhere
(no walls anymore)
the walls are falling down
no walls anymore
no walls anymore The wind's strong, the takes meanwhile the storm
blows some people into their faces
the regime breakes up because of the resistence
'Cause our future starts right now

For once find a way
To stop your talking
You talk too much, you ask for too much
I don’t know what I should remind you of
Which melody, which rhythm
With music I should make alive
The words I say
Where will my history with you lead me
While I follow you?
You talk too much, you ask for too much
For once find a way
To stop your talking
You talk too much, you ask for too much
So we’d better end it an hour sooner
Let’s finish once and for all
It wasn’t right to continue
We made lots of mistakes
You talk too much, you ask for too much

Fri?,"Ooh yeah…
Free, if I ask you, you won’t say no
Don’t we have any freedom
But, if you ask me, what our freedom is
My answer is like this:
Free, which of us are free?
Free to think for ourselves, being honest and proud of yourself, whoa…
Afraid, afraid of doing wrong, caught in a game
Where those that are alike are allowed to join the game, whoa…
Tell me, why all these demands
What make me so weak in front of your outer shell?
Who generates the speed of needs?
Who makes me a slave to publicity?
Free, which of us are free?
Free to think for ourselves, being honest and proud of yourself, whoa…
Afraid, afraid of doing wrong, caught in a game

Could It Be,"Shadows fall, it's so lonely waiting here
There's a garden bare out there, where songbirds sing no more
No golden stardust shining and no lining on the cloud
Could it be you and me have found our rainbow's end?

Autumn leaves falling softly all around
There ain't but a single sound of voices I once knew
No silver star to follow and no moon to light the way
Could it be you and me are playing 'let's pretend'?

Won't you just call me?
If I'm to blame at all, I'll say I'm sorry
It's useless standing tall, I'm longing for your touch
I'm waiting for a love I knew so well
So well

Winter cold, and the wind blows through my hair
Deep inside you know I care, no matter what's in store
Our lines of love ain't rhyming and the rhythm is all gone
Could it be you and me can't say we're on the mend?
Let's pretend

Won't you just call me?
If I'm to blame at all, I'll say I'm sorry
It's useless standing tall, I'm longing for your touch
I'm waiting for a love I knew so well
Ooh yeah...

Won't you just call me?
That's all I need to hear to ease the worry
I'll kiss each lonely tear, to me you mean so much
God knows I speak the truth and time will tell"
I anixi (Η άνοιξη),"If you come
and dress up as my night,
if you come
and hide yourself into my body,
if you come
and get trapped into my net,
there's one thing you need to know:
you will not be betrayed. It will feel like
Spring is coming,
it will be
the supreme joy for the skies,
it will feel like
Spring is coming
all of a sudden. If to the choices of the winds
we are open,
if to any action of our life
we are committed,
if our love is
tied by a knot,
then our two bodies
shall be hanging gardens. It will feel like
Spring is coming,
it will be
the supreme joy for the skies,
it will feel like
Spring is coming
all of a sudden."
Canzone per te,"Tonight, I'd like to dream a little
Hold back reality with four notes
Then, happiness will come back to my mind
If theres a song of me It will make me recognise
Your solidarity in my smile
And then kick my sadness, which is there
When you leave Take me away with you, don't ever leave me
I don't want to lose you, hold me tight because
There is a song that will tell you about me
I'm going to put all my love for you in it Then I find myself sitting in a bar
With my notes and a dream inside of me
No, no, it can't hold back reality
Come on, close your eyes and go ahead Take me away with you, don't ever leave me
I don't want to lose you, hold me tight because
There is a song that will tell you about me
I'm going to put all my love for you in it A song that will sing and live with you"
Venedig im Regen,"Venice in the rain
Lights in the rain, I've seen you
A smile like soft magic
Enchanted, frozen, completely lost in you
Feelings as deep as the night
Silent realization, and longing for more
Tender eyes, I want to belong to you
Venice in the rain
Let us this night simply dream
Venice in the rain
To the end of the night simply dream
Your light breath, buried in my shoulder
Your magic deep down in me
Felt, sensed, carried away from you
To be by you and yet not here
Silent realization, and longing for more
Tender eyes, I want to belong to you
Venice in the rain
Let us this night simply dream
Venice in the rain
To the end of the night simply dream

Un baiser volé,"A stolen kiss
How can we unite our horizons?
Free are those who don't know any sorrow
Fear makes you mad, it calls for hate
Evil grows in our minds
And yet love is the meaning of our life
A stolen kiss in this injured world can bring us hope
Saturated with images, the world is distrustful
The paths to our hearts have barriers
A lost life, a tree cut down, add my tears to the rivers
And yet love is the meaning of our life
A stolen kiss in this injured world can bring us hope
Our memories are filled by our dazzled eyes
Happiness frees our emotions (like a stolen kiss)
Like a stolen kiss (Like a stolen kiss)
And yet love is the meaning of our life
An invented story, a hope that is found back
Creates a universe without suffering"
Fångad av en stormvind,"Uh-huh yeah
Woh-ho-ho-oh I have never stopped believing
That after every night a new dawn waits
Though I can not understand
There is time for laugher as I begin once again Feeling the smell of a silent ocean
And suddenly I'm standing in the middle of a windstorm I am captured by a windstorm
Caught on you
Nothing here can stop me
When it's windy in my heart
Captured by a windstorm
Night and day
Here is only you and me
And the light the sky has left behind It's time to leave
Because times that have pass will not return
Traveling on open seas
Where everything's like new
In the future that you hold Without regrets I leave my safe harbor
Free but still tied to a set of open arms I am captured by a windstorm
Caught on you
Nothing here can stop me
When it's windy in my heart
Captured by a windstorm
Night and day
Here is only you and me
And the light the sky has left behind We walk together
Joined by the ribbons of love
My longing wakes
When you smile, and reacher out your hand I am captured by a windstorm
Captured by a windstorm
(Caught for you)
Nothing here can stop me
When it's windy in my heart
Captured by a windstorm
Night and day
Here is only you and me
And the light the sky has left behind (Captured by a windstorm)
I am captured by a windstorm"

Lusitana paixão,"Fado… to cry the sadness well
Fado…  to fall asleep with the pain
Fado… only when the longing comes
Forcing out of my past
A great love But… I do not condemn this passion
This pain of the words
That the guitar is also moaning
I do not, I will not ask for forgiveness
When enjoying sin
And to come back to give me
Because I want to be happy
And the misfortune is not spoken
I do not want what the fado wants to say. Fado… to sob memories
Fado… to revive such a pain
Fado… only when the longing comes
Forcing out of my past a great love But, I do not condemn this passion
The pain of the words
That the guitar is also moaning
I do not, I will not ask for forgiveness
When enjoying sin
 And to come back to give me
I know that aspect that is in us
Soulful Lusitanian
As the legend of Severa
Because I want to be happy
And the misfortune is not spoken
The fado does not make me repent."
Lige der hvor hjertet slår,"Where the heart beats

Do you feel like I do? Then listen to me:
Meet me where the heart beats, where love happens
Where the world ends, where the thought is turning around
Take me further out than the light can reach and hold me for a thousand years
Do you know that I'm waiting? Do you want to know where?
Where the heart beats
This night you became reality, melted into my body
Flew through the empty space
Dizzy and intoxicated, I drank of your love
Mmm... the world has changed, are we going the same way?
Oh... do you feel like I do? Then come with me
Meet me where the heart beats, where love happens
Where the world ends, where the thought is turning around

Dieser Traum darf niemals sterben,"So they taught us to fight
And we've learnt to lose
On our search for freedom
We allowed us to be tempted
No matter what they said
We believed everything
Even if many of their words
Were built on sand But one day
The time of lies will be past
Once there is no hate left
We'll be free forever This dream must never die
This dream must never fade away
Many things have yet to change
And so many things have yet to happen This dream must never die
And a miracle will happen
One day love will triumph
And one day our dream will become reality On our way to new shores
Many wishes came true
But we're reaching for the stars
And we don't mind the danger Nobody can see the shadows
That follow us at night
There is someone who's dealing the cards
And we're beyond his power But one day
The time of tears will be past
Once there is no fear left
We'll be free forever This dream must never die
This dream must never fade away
Many things have yet to change
And so many things have yet to happen This dream must never die

One day love will triumph

And 2 metres away
I’m dancing in the South pole Let’s try, just once
To dance close together, like a flame--
Held together in rhythm without ever separating
Your body from mine To dance close together is dancing
Just like the sea dances
With dolphins
Heart to heart
Two dancers in a room
The two of us, embraced tightly against each other
Carressing each other
Feeling each other’s skin
Our song is going to be played
Let’s try--try the art
Of flying To dance close together is dancing
To dance close together is dancing
Is dancing You will then find that the music
Leaves you shouting for a kiss
And the music climbs through your feet
Like something that you can’t see
Or has yet to be written To dance close together is dancing
Just like the sea dances
With dolphins
Heart to heart

Carressing each other

Our song is going to be played

A Message to Your Heart,"Half the world is hungry
Just through being born
And every day is a compromise
For a grain of corn

And half the world have too much
Their only hunger is their greed
Through politics and ignorance
Half the world's in need

A message to your heart, it's all right
Say a little prayer and sleep tonight, oh...
Tomorrow you'll still be in paradise, oh...

A message to your heart, walk on by
Till you hear the voice of conscience cry, oh...
There but for the grace of God, go I

Half the world is lucky
Born in paradise
But they don't see the children
With hunger in their eyes

And the time has come for changes
Though for some it's much too late
There's got to be an answer
The hungry cannot wait

A message to your heart, it's all right
Say a little prayer and sleep tonight, oh...
Tomorrow you'll still be in paradise, oh...

A message to your heart, walk on by
Until you hear the voice of conscience cry, oh...
There but for the grace of God, go I

Oh... a message to your heart, walk on by
Till you hear the voice of conscience cry, oh...
There but for the grace of God, go I

There but for the grace of God, go I

Comme è ddoce 'o mare,"Love, sun, sea, moon and stars
Beautiful words, they're beautiful words
Sweeter than those nobody has ever written

How sweet you are
When love is young
You feel like singing But how beautiful the sun is
When you stand by me
When I call you butterfly
Fly and I'll fly with you And round, round, the world goes
Round among the stars and I can't stop
And you sing, sing a song
That nobody can hear, that nobody knows
It has always been like this, and it'll always be the same
Love is what makes us live Love, sun, sea, moon and stars
Are always nice to sing about But how sweet the sea is
How sweet you are
When love is young
You feel like singing But how sweet the sun is
When you stand by me
When I call you butterfly
Fly and I'll fly with you When I call you butterfly
Fly and I'll fly for you"
Todo esto es la música,"All this is music
Just once before going
Far away to another place
We have to talk once again
And see if we can go on
You're my obsession, and only I beg God
That tomorrow you will remember me
Only a song can speak of love
And tell all the sorrows that I have in my heart
All this is music, which surrounds your body
Only this moment fills me with happiness
All this is music, which I have so inside of me
My memory, to be sincere, is for you
I think it was my fault
But you left without saying goodbye
Only between us, hate and love
Are in our hearts
All this is music, which surrounds your body
Only this moment fills me with happiness
All this is music, which I have so inside of me
My memory, to be sincere (is for you)
Everything good and bad in life
Makes sense with music
Music is happiness, and also sadness
Peace, harmony and dreams
And the taste of your kisses
All this is music, which surrounds your body
Only this moment fills me with happiness
All this is music, which I have so inside of me
My memory, to be sincere, is for you, is for you"
"Nous, on veut des violons","We want violins
In sweatshirt, in trousers, crazy generation
We hide our emotions underneath the skin of a jacket
Yes, but underneath the appearance, but behind the carefreeness
We say nothing about our injuries, my generation assures
In rap and in funky, generation Gorby
We hide our shivers underneath tons of concrete
But that look of carefreeness is nothing but an appearance
In the land without borders, my generation hopes
We want violins and statues of stone
Thousand years of tradition, feelings in the air
We want violins, birds, phantasms
And declarations that can't be changed
We want violins
We have no history, no past, no memory
My heart pounds underneath my smile-for-the-show
I show the indifference, it's nothing but an appearance
Underneath those coloured masks, my generation is afraid
We want violins and statues of stone
Thousand years of tradition, feelings in the air
We want violins, birds, phantasms
And declarations that can't be changed
We want violins
We want violins, we want a whole orchestra
And afterwards emotions, and afterwards drunken nights
We want violins
We want violins and statues of stone
Thousand years of tradition, feelings in the air
We want violins, birds, phantasms
And declarations that can't be changed
We want violins
We want violins
We want violins
We want violins"
Ze rak sport (זה רק ספורט),"I am a prisoner of the melody, the addict to the rhythm
That is why I believe in the fight against sadness
To dance away all the distress, to sing into the darkness
To plant for three minutes the flickering of happiness
And I have no desire to mince words
This patronising is a tiring thing
And I don’t mind not caring because the game is fun
If there is a chance of one in a thousand to soar
And if the girl doesn’t do well
She won’t cry, she won’t declare this her day of death
Because it’s just sport, yes, it’s just sport
It’s just sport, just sport
Because it’s just sport, yes, it’s just sport
It’s just sport, just sport
Yes, life is a fast line, and it’s a sure thing
But tonight I have a song, and everything is still open
I think that here, in the Promised Land
You understand those who are willing to take the risk
And I have no desire to mince words
It’s just nice and good for me doing a sloppy job
With a guitarist and a drummer and with a cheeky keyboard player
And with a chance of one in a thousand to soar
And if the girl doesn’t do well
She won’t cry, she won’t declare this her day of death
Because it’s just sport, yes, it’s just sport
It’s just sport, just sport
Because it’s just sport, yes, it’s just sport
It’s just sport, just sport
And if the girl doesn’t do well
She won’t cry, she won’t declare this her day of death
Viva sport, oh viva sport
Viva, viva sport
Viva sport, oh viva sport
Viva, viva sport
Papa pada papa papa dei…

I morgon är en annan dag,"There is a girl that I visit once in a while
She likes me because I always do what I can
There is so much hidden in her silence that I want to know
So I'll stay all night, even though we're like fire and water (Come here) As long as my heart is beating
(Come here) As long as there is still tension
Tomorrow will be another day (Come here) As long as the sun is smiling
(Come here) As long as our desire is a matter of giving and taking
Things are passing by so quickly
Tomorrow will be another day She paints pictures that I never get to see
She sings songs when nobody is sitting next to her
In her eyes, there's a longing for more
So I'll stay all night, even though we're like fire and water (Come here) As long as my heart is beating

Amor d'água fresca,"Fresh water love

And your black berry mouth
So much honey, so much sun
In your juicy and wild lock of hair
I was sure it was you
My grape sugar
And nut on the table
The love of strawberry and cashew
I picked you, bit into you and put you in the basket
You laughed and made my head spin

I want your fresh water love
I picked you, bit into you and put you in the basket
You laughed and made my head spin
Come here, I'm thirsty
I want your fresh water love, oh...
A tang of orange in your skin
And three segments of laughter in your kiss
So much honey, so much sun, fruit, juice, fresh water
I tasted and I went crazy
It was in the morning that was alight in you
Avocado, wild plum
And French pear, pomegranate
Raspberry, kiwi
I picked you, bit into you and put you in the basket

A night with no tomorrow

Which mix to become water and vanish
We’re alike, we’re alike
Scattered signs, bodies surrendering
And me begging for your touch
In a complete picture, a mad minefield
I become an explosion in front of you
We’re alike, you want what I want

Stay as free as high winds on the seas
No destiny bringin’ lonely tears

Smile, live today, and leave the past behind
Live it up day by day, and surely you may find
That both sorrow and tomorrow aren’t worth a thought or two
Look at me and teach me to live again

Little child, your look elates me
It’s an answer your eyes give
Now, you see, I’m on the road again
I’m bringin’ out what child there’s in me

That both sorrow and tomorrow aren’t worth a thought or two
Look at me and teach me to live again

Sing, live today, this moment can’t endure

Be it sadness, be it gladness, we can start it all anew
Look at me, look at me, and the sun comes shining through"

Mister Music Man,"How I dreamed of being able to hold him in my arms

Mister Music Man
Do you want to play a sweet air?
Do you have a slow nothing for us?
I so dream of being able to hold him in my arms Mister Music Man
Do you have a song from another time
That will push him to dance with me
Mister, be a love, come to my aid It's incredible, I really didn't expect it
Unthinkable, since I came here alone this evening Mister Music Man
Do you want to play a sweet air for me?
Lower the lights around us
And let us dance it tenderly
And then, I ask of you Mister, if you agree
Play it again It's incredible, I who had lost all hope

When his laughter bubbles out the dark turns to light

There is another world where all men understand each other

A ship, that was so full of love, sails badly on its own
I'm frightened to be out there, now, to be totally without you
I wonder, how that can die
Do you maybe, with me again, want to...
Go together to the horizon?
Together with you, together strong
Go together, so far with you
For two people who love each other so much, waiting is still too much
No ocean was too big for us, no dawn was too far away
I thought you'd never let me go after such a long time
Your farewell hurts deep inside of me
But maybe tomorrow we will...
Go together to the horizon
Together with you, together strong
Go together, so far with you
For two people who love each other so much, waiting is still too much
Go together to the horizon

Go together, so far with you

One Step Out of Time,"Don't walk away
Just let your heart decide
If love is gonna stay
I know it's right
Just think about it, girl
Ooh for a while

Another week
Another day
When I call
You're miles away
In the arms
Of another

All my friends say
I'm crazy
Night after night
I'm waiting
Say that I'm wrong
Then you tell me
That I'm coming on too strong

One step out of time
One reason to put this love on the line again
Can't believe that it's true
Now I'm one step out of time

When I sleep
I dream of you
You're in my mind
In everything I do
Well I still don't feel that it's over

I know what's right
Could be with you
Holding you tight
Now that you've gone
Won't you tell me
Where I've been going wrong

One step out of time
One reason to put this love on the line again
Can't believe that it's true
Now I'm one step out of time

Another week
Another day
When I call
You're miles away, daddy
Daddy now, you're still it's over

One step out of time
One reason to put this love on the line again
Can't believe that it's true
Now I'm one step out of time

One step, One step out of time

Why Me?,"Sometimes I watch you passing by my window
And sometimes I watch you passing through my dreams
And sometimes, when I look at you

And sometimes, when I turn around
And you're there, like today
I wanna say:

Why me?
I look at you and I get to feeling
Why me? (Why me, whooh)
I know it's true but I can't believe it
I keep on wondering why
My love shines in your eyes
Why me?
I look at you and I ask myself
Why me?

Sometimes I lie awake and watch you sleeping
And listen to the beating of your heart
And sometimes, when you're lying there
You take my breath away
And I wanna say

Why me?
I look at you and I get to feeling
Why me? (Why me, whooh)
I know it's true but I can't believe that it's me
Who's gonna be holdin' you in my arms tonight
And why it's me
Who's gonna be the one to make you feel all right
Tonight

Why me?

When all the things that nobody sees
Nobody minds that, like this affair
All the things that nobody knows
That can't be any of their business
What do we do, if someone sees us leave the party?
Yes, by the way
I know a trick that won't disgrace us:
We've left, because you've had
A drop more than you should have
Don't give me that

Rapsodia,"One day the old lovers
Meet in a bar
Deceitful but sincere telling how it goes
It was raining outside and they were there
Thinking about who knows where
Who knows why it finished. One day the old lovers tell each other their ages
Sweet resentments and other truth Who are we, feeling lost?
So different from the heroes in our movie
With the irony and a bit of trouble
In this immense rhapsody, now about us But one day the old lovers long for more
Dreams and desires of another youth
And they leave their families, betray their friends
They don't want advice about how to be happy And when the old lovers leave each other at the bar
They will become songs of a time far behind Who are we, sitting here?
Listening to a story of a life that didn't work out
Who are we, sunk in shame
For this immense and hopeless rhapsody Oh who are we, sunk in shame
For this immense and hopeless rhapsody"
Ljubim te pesmama (Љубим те песмама),"I prayed to God

Visjoner,"Visions from a dream lend us reflections and a prayer
Let the future be ours

Can the past give birth to the children of the future? A century is dying away, a new time is knocking on our door
Has progress misled us?
The fire of the past has got a hot blaze
Nature has been scared, values are at risk
Now we see all the mistakes of yesterday But hope is lit, it can never be too late
For wisdom to take root
Which gives us the urge to create and courage
Culture is a heritage for the people of our land
It's a mirror of past times Give us a sunrise with children's laughter and singing
We love our father and our mother
Have love for our sister and our brother
Give us a sunrise and let our dream come true
We'll walk together hand in hand on the road of hope We only have this very world, let tomorrow be a friend
Show charity
And you will be rewarded with honesty
Let the big ones and the small ones share the same table
In living and growing friendship Give us a sunrise with children's laughter and singing
We love our father and our mother
Have love for our sister and our brother
Give us a sunrise and let our dream come true
We'll walk together hand in hand on the road of hope (Give us a sunrise with children's laughter and singing)

Show me the way, the way for everyone I searched for myself, here and in other countries
And have been in search of friends for eternity
I found the truth, but I’ve seen it stranding again
The stupid dreams, stolen by the time What is this life? How far can you go?
Which one can help you? Feeling or reason?
The way you search for in yourself
Never stops, never stands still, lets you live Show me the way to my own sense

Sole d'Europa,"Sun of Europe
They run in their cars, they play taking each other
Along a street bathed in bars
They play living but they wear themselves out

And the first light comes, beyond the outskirts
And little houses carry them away
And the dreams never change
Hurry up, sun, make you see
They shoot again but they're waiting for you
Put a beam in your heart, if you discover where it is
Rise for me, come up with me, warm me up again
They don't know each other, still they resemble each other
And the dreams never change
If they take your hand, they are looking for some company
But the wind and the war carry them away
But the dreams never change
Wake up, sun, so we can feel you
Today nobody asks for you
Cover Europe with light, do you remember where it is?
Come with me, fly with me, warm me up again
They change their uniform and colour
But their tired souls wait for the sun
And they say he'll come
They believe he'll come
Wake us up, sun, make us understand
How much pain you've carried with you
Give us a light beam in this gloom
Rise for us, come up with us, warm us up again"

 All your torches crackle in vain
 I won’t come prancing Chorus: (x2)
Out of question to burn my wings
 Out of question to follow your steps
 I don’t have time And if tomorrow luck is with me
 First of all, I want to be myself
 Quite simply myself"
Under stjernerne på himlen,"I sit down on the edge of your bed,
and you laugh with me.
The world shrinks into nothing,
when I see you.
You lie so very still,
seeming so indescribably little
between your many funny animals.
But in our dream game
the two of us will find our way
to new adventures Under the stars in the sky
you're sailing with me.
Close your eyes slowly,
then we'll be on our way.
We're sailing on the water,
and into our land of dreams,
you and me. And if you're scared by the wind,
I'll gently kiss your cheek.
No matter where you are in your imagination,
I'll always be
here with you, my dear.
Please put your hand in mine with confidence. Under the stars in the sky
you're sailing with me.
Close your eyes slowly,
then we'll be on our way.
We're sailing on the water,
and into our land of dreams,
you and me.
Our land of dreams, you and me."
"Ellada, hora tou fotos (Ελλάδα, χώρα του φωτός)","Greece, country of light
The world’s beginning and comeback
A place chosen by God
Something’s going on, you don’t give a damn
Difficult times are coming
And the sky is shouting to you
Sit down and think, get to your senses
One time they play us rock music and the other tsifteteli
Children of Plato and Aristotle
They trick us with sadness and taste
Oh immortal spirit, the evil is destroying you
One time they play us rock music and the other tsifteteli

Iemand als jij,"I have never loved someone like this
All my doubts are gone forever
I have never had that nice feeling before
You are everything I mean In your eyes I see that clear blue
A warm feeling that I love

Someone like you Wherever I am, you will be with me
With you I keep finding the right way
I have never loved someone like this
Someone like you You will always be in my thoughts
Whatever may happen to us
Know for sure that I will wait for you
Even in the middle of the night
You give me wings, that free feeling
That is exactly what I mean I have never loved someone like this
Someone like you
Someone like...
Someone like you"
This Time,"Ooh baby, when I'm alone with you
You show your love for me
I believed that our love was for real
But I knew it was too good to be true

Oh baby, baby, when I found out that
You were foolin' around with my heart
It hurt so much, pain unexplained
How could you do it
I thought I found love

This time
I'm gonna stand on my own
I said, now, baby, this time
I won't be missin' you at all
No, no, now, baby, this time

It hurt so much
Pain unexplained
How could you do it
When I thought I found love?

I am and wait for you there
Your mind carries you elsewhere but where?
Still you keep going, questions burn I wait
You search for answers everywhere
Where does this journey end?
Why do we go?
Then years pass
And leave behind a small advice
If you look for me
Then you know the answer Why are you running, looking far and nearby?
I'm not hiding from you, I am everywhere I wait

Maria Magdalena,"Mary Magdalene
Mary Magdalene – give me your power
Forever and not just for one night
Like thunder without any warning, like the first day
Like the Flood, more than I can suffer
You were coming over me, you ran over me
You conquered my heart in a storm, like a hurricane
Heaven or hell
Where you come from is all the same to me
Both inside of you, good and evil
It makes me poor and rich
Mary Magdalene – you are happiness and sorrow
Mary Magdalene – give me eternity
Mary Magdalene – give me your might
Forever and not just for one night
Your eyes crying for love
Yearning is the name for your look
Going onwards, never again backwards
You are one of the sirens, seen by Odysseus
I untie myself and place myself in danger
Only those who suffer are alive
Who feels nothing are dead
To take pain, to give love
That's my command
Mary Magdalene – you are happiness and sorrow
Mary Magdalene – give me eternity
Mary Magdalene – give me your might
Forever and not just for one night
Maria Magdalena – you are happiness and sorrow
Maria Magdalena – give me eternity
Maria Magdalena – give me your might
Forever and not just for one night"
A cidade (Até ser dia),"In the morning I go out, into the street
The city is in front of me
And suddenly the city is yours and mine
The city is everyone's Between a gin and a kiss
We're going from bar to bar
I feel everything I see
There's a glow in the air When the night falls in the city
There's always a dream and there's magic
At night in the city
There's always a dream until it's daytime The colours of the night
Give a glow to the city
They make light until it's dawn Between the moon and the sun
We're going from street to street
Tomorrow morning
It'll be another day When the night falls in the city
There's always a dream and there's magic
At night in the city
There's always a dream until it's daytime (When the night falls in the city)
(There's always a dream and there's magic)
At night in the city
There's always a dream When the night falls in the city
There's always a dream and there's magic
At night in the city
There's always a dream
Until it's daytime"

Some fruits, a bit of bread

Who bear their story inside themselves

Was crazy in love with her
Drawing her with his fingers Mama Corsica

Tonight the world has only eyes for you

When they are far from home
Mama Corsica She smiles when you’re thinking of her
She likes it when you’re faithful to her

Basically it’s her who unites us
Mama Corsica Never mind that there are differences
She doesn’t have preferences
All her children have Corsican blood Mama Corsica,

Eloise,"I'm Gathering my thoughts all by myself before I go out
I thought I was smart when I broke up , ah...
I'm longing for you and now I'm standing outside your door
When I ring the bell, will you open
Or do you want to go away?
So, I'm begging you, please come out Eloise, are we more than just friends?
So show what you feel and then let the feelings decide
Eloise, even the winds can change, for me you are the only one
Our love is worth a higher price, Eloise It's not easy when you can't realise your faults
I'm like a ball in a pinball machine, ah...
I'm longing for you and now I'm standing outside your door
When I ring the bell, will you open
Or do you want to go away?
So, I'm begging you, please come out Whoa...Eloise, are we more than just friends?
So show what you feel and then let the feelings decide
Eloise, even the winds can change, for me you are the only one
Our love is worth a higher price, Eloise I'm waiting, hoping and longing, so tell me... Eloise, even the winds can change, for me you are the only one
Our love is worth a higher price, Eloise"
In Your Eyes,"Showing no emotion
My feelings locked inside
I made myself an island
Trying to take my heart and hide

I built a wall around me
Afraid of letting go
But suddenly an open door
I never saw before

In your eyes
I see the light
Leading me home again
It's heaven in your arms, my love
My heart is in your hands
In your eyes
Seems so right
I see forever in your smile
This woman is a child again
(In your eyes)

Love's been building bridges
Between your heart and mine
I'm safe here on my island
But I'm out on the edge this time
I built a wall around me
Thought I'd save myself the pain
Your touch swept me away
Now I'll never play it safe again

In your eyes
I see the light
Leading me home again
It's heaven in your arms, my love
My heart is in your hands
In your eyes
Seems so right
I see forever in your smile
This woman is a child again

I've never been this close
How do I know love will survive?
I'm walking a tightrope
Here in your arms I'm alive

I'm in your eyes
I see the light
I see forever in your smile
This woman is a child again

I'm in your eyes
I see the light
I see the light
Whoa...
I see forever in your smile
This woman is a child again
When I look in your eyes"
Donne-moi une chance,"Alone, gazing at nighttime
A shining star, maybe for me
Its not easy to say that my life is overturning
I need you It's a game that we have to live through
I want to know if the game is lost
But I still want to believe in it
To tell you all my hopes loudly Give me a chance to tell you
The words to guide you
Along the roads of your desire Give me a chance to tell you
The words to seduce you
Live out all our pleasures once again Dréi méng Welt an eng kleng léiw Suerg
Sief méng Rous, déi och ëmmer fir mech bléit
Sief mäi Stär an der Nuecht
But I still want to believe in it
To tell you all my hopes loudly Give me a chance to tell you
The words to guide you
Along the roads of your desire Give me a chance to tell you
The words to seduce you
Live out all our pleasures once again Tomorrow, maybe, you will go far away
But give me my chance, I need you so much Give me a chance to tell you
The words to guide you
Along the roads of your desire Give me a chance to tell you
The words to seduce you
Live out all our pleasures once again"
Tih deževen dan,"A quiet rainy day, I close my eyes and travel far away
I paint a shade over the bygone days and I'm no longer there
How well do I blend into this world that's intoxicating me
How I'm pulled into a time that doesn't exist What would the world do without dreams? (What would it?)
When happiness is wasted on nothing?
What would time do without dreams? (What would it?)
Life would be futile otherwise What would the world do without dreams? (What would it?)
When happiness is wasted on nothing?
What would time do without dreams? (What would it?)
Time without dreams The sky is blue, a bell is ringing in the distance
In the morning breeze another poor soul is hurrying after me How well do I blend into this world that's intoxicating me
How I'm pulled into a time that doesn't exist What would the world do without dreams? (What would it?)
When happiness is wasted on nothing?
What would time do without dreams? (What would it?)
Life would be futile otherwise What would the world do without dreams? (What would it?)
When happiness is wasted on nothing?
What would time do without dreams? (What would it?)

Baby, don't do things that make me blue
You know my love is always true
Baby, don't do things that make me cry
I just can't seem to sleep at night

You know I love him every day
It breaks my heart when he goes away

Better the devil you know than the devil you don't
I'll give you my heart and my soul if you give me your love
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't

I tell him that I love him most every day
I'm out of my head, I don't know what to say
He never plays around like the other guys do

You know I love him every day
It breaks my heart when he goes away

Vrede,"Even the most expensive car can't swim
And when it's wet, it has trouble braking
That's why something is done to the asphalt
So that no drop of water remains on it We all know that magicians deceive
And that no man on earth can fly by himself
The real reason why the airplane exists now
Is the fact that gliding doesn't happen on its own We build houses to withstand hurricanes
And make ships to sail in every storm
We're working on a light bulb that never burns out
It only just won't work to keep peace
(To keep) Each new apple tree that is born
Isn't endowed by nature with ears to hear
But through genetics we'll manage to teach it
To guarantee taste and quality We build houses to withstand hurricanes
And make ships to sail in every storm
We're working on a light bulb that never burns out
It only just won't work to keep peace When no bridge is too far
Every clock will chime at the same hour
When no road is too long
No man wants to hit another man ever again
Woh, oh... We build houses to withstand hurricanes
And make ships to sail in every storm
We're working on a light bulb that never burns out
It only just won't work to keep peace"

Don't ever cry, don't ever cry

Hombres,"Men
All men are so selfish
That they've mistaken male for macho
All men are so conceited
That they've forgotten to be thankful
They're like this by nature
They live, ruled by their vanity
They run, driven by their longing for winning
And nothing else
They use their brain, never their heart
They fly like crows around you
And they say love for sex
They're like this since prehistory
They follow the whims of their will
When they've got everything, they always want much more
It's normal
Whatever they may say, they're right
Whatever they may do, I'm telling you
They can't say sorry
All men are untidy
And they keep being spoiled children
All men are so special
That they've managed to be all the same
But if they're not around, we feel lonely
They say little honeymouthed words
Such beautiful things that make us sigh
And drive us crazy
Men and women in intimacy
Are like two lighthouses in the dark
Like two mysteries to be solved
They're complementary like war and peace
Like sun and moon, like land and sea
They're irresistible, they're like a magnet
That makes the world go round
Whatever they may say, they're right
Whatever they may do, I'm telling you
They can't say sorry
Men and women in intimacy
Are like two lighthouses in the dark
Like two mysteries to be solved
They're complementary like war and peace
Like sun and moon, like land and sea
They're irresistible, they're like a magnet
That makes the world go round
Men and women in intimacy
Are like two lighthouses in the dark
Like two mysteries to be solved

Like sun and moon, like land and sea
They're irresistible, they're like a magnet
That makes the world go round"
Mi stamatas (Μη σταματάς),"Into our lives we enter naked

Don’t overtake, don’t fear seeing the wrecks
And if life is occasionally hurt by the truth
Don’t stop, don’t stop
Whatever you own I own as well, brother
But there are others who never laughed
Their sight is unclear
And they carry a cross
Don’t stop helping people
Don’t overtake, don’t fear seeing the wrecks
And if life is occasionally hurt by the truth
Don’t stop, don’t stop
And if life is occasionally hurt by the truth
Don’t stop, don’t stop

Shiru (שירו),"On the banks of the Jordan, in bygone times
I grew up among other people who sing
They sang in the warm night to cheer up their spirit
And they are those who left me my songs
Sing, sing with a great voice
Don’t leave strength for tomorrow
Sing, sing and light a fire
Because the song is all we have
Sing, sing with a great voice
Don’t leave strength for tomorrow
Sing, sing and light a fire
Because the song is all we have
And since then the songs accompany my life
I always sing with my brothers and friends
The warm singing of many people could break any wall
And open hearts, plant loves
Sing, sing with a great voice
Don’t leave strength for tomorrow
Sing, sing and light a fire
Because the song is all we have
Sing a song, sing till you can no more
Let the world know what you’re singing for
Sing a song, oh, sing it loud and high
Till it reaches up to the sky
The land has changed its image and its spirit
But the singing of many people hasn’t lost its strength
This song is uniting and it remains for us a witness
And in every generation, the people carry a song
Sing, sing with a great voice
Don’t leave strength for tomorrow
Sing, sing and light a fire
Because the song is all we have
All we have
Sing a song, sing till you can no more
Let the world know what you’re singing for
Sing a song, oh, sing it loud and high
Till it reaches up to the sky
Let the world know
Sing a song

Alle mine tankar,"When I meet you in the street
And you stop and smile this strange smile
And you stand there, pretending nothing has happened
Afraid to meet my glance
No one can see it only you and I know it When I meet you in the evening
And you look at me with this strange light
And you gently touch me
On the hand as you walk past me
No one must see it, only you and I know it All my thoughts, they fly to you
All my dreams are open
In all my rooms, I can only see you
You are lying in my bed sleeping When you're among your friends
And your beautiful laughter melts my skin
And you pretend you've never seen me before
You are like a distant and cool god
No one must see it, only you and I know it All my thoughts, they fly to you
All my dreams are open
In all my rooms, I can only see you
You are lying in my bed sleeping All my thoughts, they fly to you

You are lying in my bed sleeping, sleeping"
Stjärnorna,"The sun is awake
So I'll ask myself if this will be a splendid day
Or will it disappear at the first sign of rain?
It'd just remind me of the tears I've cried in loneliness
And that's what I fear But if the sun decides to share its light
It might be just enough to lead into A starlit night, much brighter than a day
To raise a hope for love
To guide us when the times keep changing A starlit night that helps us find our way
For hearts might go astray
On our search for a place to stay
Oh... come and take my hand, join me tonight The sun is awake
If only I could see the things that one can see up there
I'd know of all the things in life
And I could just tell what will happen to us a day from now
If it stays around But if the sun decides to share its light
It might be just enough to lead into A starlit night, much brighter than the day
To raise a hope for love
To guide us when the times keep changing A starlit night that helps us find our way
For hearts might go astray
I'm out of my mind, so I still need A starlit night, much brighter than the day
To raise a hope for love
To guide us... A starlit night that helps us find our way
For hearts might go astray
On our search, oh... take my hand
Oh... take my hand, join me tonight"
Bye Bye Baby,"Bye, bye baby
When I looked at your blue eyes
I believed so to find happiness from you
I loved you, forgot the others
I wanted you to be my own
But I got to hear
That I'm not the only one for you
When I close the door last time carefully
You are history to me
Bye bye baby, baby goodbye
I'll go away, though I'm left alone
Bye bye baby, baby, goodbye
I won't cry, when this ends
When I take a look back, you're only a memory
A memory of a past love
You'll find another
Who falls in love with you, believes your lies
Still I'll trust in love, the eternal power
I have a destination, yesterday stays behind
It was a deceptive dream
Bye bye baby, baby goodbye
I'll go away, though I'm left alone
Bye bye baby, baby, goodbye
I won't cry, when this ends
If I dare start love again
Maybe tomorrow reaches happiness again
Bye bye baby, baby goodbye
I'll go away, though I'm left alone
Bye bye baby, baby, goodbye
I won't cry, when this ends
Bye bye baby, baby goodbye
I'll go away, though I'm left alone
Bye bye baby, baby, goodbye
I won't cry, when this ends"
Rock 'n' Roll Kids,"I remember '62
I was sixteen and so were you
And we lived next door,
On the avenue.
Jerry Lee was big and Elvis too;
Blue jeans and blue suede shoes,
And we never knew
What life held in store.
We just wanted to rock 'n' roll forever more.

We were the Rock 'n' Roll Kids
And Rock 'n' Roll was all we did
And listening to those songs on the radio;
I was yours and you were mine
But that was once upon a time,
Now we never seem to Rock 'n' Roll anymore.

Now Johnny's in love with the girl next door,
And Mary's down at the record store,
They don't want to be... Around us no more.
""Golden Oldies"" but we hardly speak
Too busy running to a different beat
Hard to understand, we were once like them.
How I wish we could find those Rock 'n' Roll days again.

We were the Rock 'n' Roll Kids
And Rock 'n' Roll was all we did,
And listening to those songs on the radio;
I was yours and you were mine,
But that was once upon a time,
Now we never seem to Rock and Roll anymore.

I was yours and you were mine
That was once upon a time,
Now we never seem to Rock and Roll...

We just never seem to Rock and Roll anymore."
Ime anthropos ki ego (Είμαι άνθρωπος κι εγώ),"I don’t wait for a special day
Like a Sunday which doesn’t
Fit my awful silence
To wake up with an immortal kiss
A shiny night, you’ll get hidden again
You shake as a boy in case they discover
You put on the uniform so that
No how’s and why’s can touch you
I’m a person too, and I will shout tonight
I’m a person too, I’m fed up, I’ll change
You’re a person too, you’ve got my own life in your hands
And before I manage to tell you that I love you
You kill me, but I’m a person too
And when in morning in the mirror
I’ll be afraid to look at myself, in case I call myself a liar
I’ll be asking if I made all these marks
I had in mind
I’m a person too, and I will shout tonight
I’m a person too, I’m fed up, I’ll change
You’re a person too, you’ve got my own life in your hands
And before I manage to tell you that
I’m a person too
A piece of the same God of yours
And I’m entitled to cry, to laugh, to feel pain
Below the same sky where others fly, I’ll fly
But I’m a person too
And I have your own life in my hands
And before you manage to tell me you love me
I kill you
Because I’m a person too
I’m a person too

Nætur,"Nights, land of dreams
Dark blue sky above the horizon
Nights, there you are
There I drift in my dream All that I wish for is woven in the white clouds
Grand thoughts, in the twilight it's you that I enjoy
As night falls I disappear, where my mind takes me
Sleep beckons, lures me away
The path is clear Nights, land of dreams
Dark blue sky above the horizon
Nights, there you are
There I drift in my dream Everything that no one can see, I spot in the middle of the night
As I sleep I send you my message, yes
The silence carries such secrets, over there (Nights) oh land of dreams
Dark blue sky above the horizon
Nights, there you are
There I drift (in my dream) And tonight, silently, I am there
Still, soaring in my mind
Creep in, this time, I capture you (Nights) oh land of dreams
Dark blue sky above the horizon
Nights, there you are
There I drift in my dream
Message to you (Nights) there you are
There I drift in my dream
(And tonight, silently)
Now in a dream
(And tonight, silently)
Now in a dream"
We Will Be Free (Lonely Symphony),"Walk into the box
Let your secrets out
Time for confession
Purify your soul
Denounce the devil from within
No time for aggression
Don't wait up in vain
Love has lost its way
We live in segregation
Can't you see the piece of dust
That crumbles in your hand is me?
Give me some affection

And though my heart is broken
My picture is forgotten
But I still believe
That I can see
A piece of me reflecting in your eye

(We will rise)
(Never fall) Never fall
(We will be free) And we will be free
(We will rise) We will rise
(Never fall again) We'll never fall again
(We will be free) And we will be free

Welcome to the land
Where all our dreams are planned
And fighting is a thing to do
Sometimes it makes me feel
Naked like a tree in autumn
And through the clouds and rain
Love has come to stake its claim
In an ugly way
And while you dance beneath an angry star
I'm chasing rainbows across the sun

And in this mad equation
I still believe that we can be
In harmony, you and me
A chorus in your lonely symphony

(We will rise)
(Never fall) We'll never fall
(We will be free) And we will be free
(We will rise) We will rise
(Never fall again) We'll never fall again
(We will be free) And we will be free
(We will rise)
(Never fall) We'll never fall
(We will be free) And we will be free

And in this mad equation
I still believe that we can be
In harmony
You and me
A chorus in your lonely symphony

(We will rise)
(Never fall) We'll never fall
(We will be free) And we will be free
(We will rise) We will rise
(Never fall again) We'll never fall again
(We will be free) And we will be free

We'll never fall
We will be free
With a little love
(We will rise) We will be free
(Never fall again) We'll never fall
(We will be free) And we will be free"
Nek' ti bude ljubav sva,"Rain is coming from the north
Pillow smells, but your unfidelity hurts
You aren't here, the morning is waking me up
Who kissed you, who burned everything in your eyes? The one who took you, took everything from me too
You sold me, whoa...
You can fight for love, but I don't have any strength
I don't have, I don't have any strenfgth... He can have all your love (Love)
My soul is tired
The biggest sadness is flowing in my veins
But you ain't going out of me, oh...
You ain't going out of me, oh... You don't love me, you don't love me any more
My love could last for hundred years He can have all your love (Love)
My soul is tired
The biggest sadness is flowing in my veins He can have all your love (Love)
My soul is tired
But you ain't going out of me, oh...
You ain't going out of me oohh"
Chamar a música,"Tonight I'll stay like this
Prisoner of that stare
Of honey resting on me
I'll call the music
Put my voice to the test
In a verse just for us Tonight I'll drink liquor
Like a redemptive filter
Of love, love, love
I'll call the Music
I'll hold your hand
I'll make a song Call the Music
The Music
Have it here so close
Like the wind in the desert
Woken up in me
Call the Music
The Music
Muse of my songs
In this night of flowers [Madonna Lillies]
Just embracing you
Is calling the Music Tonight I don't want the TV
Or the common newspaper
Nobody reads
I'll call the Music
Murmur a madrigal
Invent a ritual Tonight I'll serve a tea
Made of herbs and jasmine
And aromas that don't exist
I'll call the Music
Find on the surface of my being
A poem of satin Call the Music
The Music
Have it here so close
Like the wind in the desert
Woken up in me
Call the Music
The Music
Muse of my songs
In this night of flowers [Madonna Lillies]
Just embracing you
Is calling the Music"
Sto pregando,"I'm praying for those who still haven't understood
That life has only one great pain
Who believe as much as is written, certainly will be reborn
That day will be a great and sweet one
I'm praying for you
For all the bad around
That encircles life I'm praying for everyone
For the destroyed dreams
Why not believe? I'm praying that tomorrow,
Heaven, sun, the stars,
That you'll forgive every error I'm praying for those
That search for love
And don't know where it is I'm praying for you
For all the bad around
That encircles life I'm praying for everyone
For the destroyed dreams
Why not believe? I'm praying that tomorrow,
Heaven, sun, the stars
That you'll forgive every error I'm praying for those
That search for love
And don't know where it is I'm praying in the silence of the memories
That the time of my dreams returns again
A light will shine for those that will know
To search for the sun in the darkness"
Nagu merelaine,"I arrive secretly, as a wave,
that brings the amber to the shore
And the taste of the sea on my lips is earthly,
as a garment flickers as a wing I can be as ice or burning hot,
the core of your every dream
And in the white night as faithful as a shadow
So I brought myself to you,
though I know that tomorrow I may
become just a name on your lips And I also change as a wave,
that doesn't have boundaries
You are a man and I am a woman,
I know some things that you don't know I'm like day, you're like night,
one is like the sea, the other is like the land
How many feelings can there be between us,
no one can guess.
The sea will change, so will the land. (I can be as ice or burning hot)
the core of your every dream
And in the white night as faithful as a shadow
So I brought myself to you,
though I know that tomorrow I may
become just a name on your lips Become just a name on your lips"
Dincolo de nori,"Beyond the clouds
The coming day you may listen to me
I have chosen the bad as well as the good
Part of myself I leave in your hands
Nights without dreams, questions without answer
I wake up my hidden soul from my memories
Beyond the clouds, there is a ray of light
Beyond the clouds, there is my world, the world
I am not asking for forgiveness for all I have done
I am asking for a ray of love to start all over again
I now have the power now to make a change in the world
I have the power to dream
(Beyond the clouds, beyond the clouds)
Beyond the clouds
(Beyond the clouds)
There is my world, there is my world
(Beyond the clouds)
There is my world, world, world, world, world
(Beyond the clouds)
There is my world
(Beyond the clouds)
There is my world"
More Than Love,"Swiftly movin' on
The days I see
Often ask myself
What I really wanna be

To dream of an aim
To reach it with fame
Not easy to say
There's will, there's a way

More than love
What music gives to me
Body and soul
Live in reality

Glistening on a star
Of promises and dreams
Some take me for a laugh
But they don't know what it means

To tell you the truth
I'll never change my youth
Not easy to say
There's will, there's a way

More than love
What music gives to me
Body and soul
Livin' in harmony

More than love
(Please, God, hear me now)
What music gives to me
(You gotta help me, you gotta help me)
Body and soul
Live in reality
(Ho, ho)

More than love
(Please, God)
What music gives to me
(You gotta help me, yeah)
Body and soul
There for eternity

This life is what I own
Gotta make it through
I'm liftin' up my heart
And I'm givin' it to you"
Waar is de zon,"Where have you been?
Where did you go?
I even wrote to you
But now I'm so tired I'd buried myself
I'd lost everything
My safe heaven
My peace, my battle Where is the sun that will warm me?
Where are your arms and where is the source?
Where is the light that will finally shine?
That will make the cold disappear?
I look for your face The pain has disappeared
But the chilliness remains
I'm waiting for that one thing
That will drive the silence away I'm waiting for a sign
A voice or a word
That will break through this
As long as you hear me But where is the sun that will warm me?
Where are your arms and where is the source?
Where is the light that will finally shine?
That will make the cold disappear?
I look for your face And suddenly you were there
I saw you go again
I even stepped aside
But you kept standing next to me You kept walking beside me
You went back home with me again
My heart opened again
I feel home again You are the sun that will warm me
Your strong arms, they form my source
You are the light that will shine again
That will make the cold disappear
I see your face"

Nekonečná pieseň,"I love everything that burns.
I love to play with fire
i was born in it's sign I dedicated my life to a storm
my blood is burning
I am not waiting for orders
I have burned a sign of my destiny to my forehead I am. Yes I am flammable, flaming desires are blazing in my head.
One thing I know: 'till I’m alive I’ll never leave this sign. I’m a child of flames, I’ll light up your way
I’ll die with hope, as the last one I love everything that burns.
Hot lips and frost.
There are no bonfires on the hilltops anymore1.
I don't want to watch anymore at what remains from us.
I’m blowing into embers still smoldering inside us.
If you burned out, than I just didn't. I am. Yes I am flammable, flaming desires are blazing in my head.
One thing I know: 'till I’m alive I’ll never leave this sign. I am. Yes I am flammable, flaming desires are blazing in my head.
One thing I know: 'till I’m alive I’ll never leave this sign. I am. Yes I am flammable, flaming desires are blazing in my head.
One thing I know: 'till I’m alive I’ll never leave this sign."
Lopšinė mylimai,"Your lips smell like the rain
It's a sin to touch them, I pray for it to come true
My dream will enter you
It won't let you be alone in the dark My untouched string,
I haven't touched you
My dream is pouring wine into you
At our night Every night blossom has closed its eyes already
It's just your deep sky.
The flowers, like you, cry without love
And keep on dreaming the same dreams. My untouched string,
I haven't touched you
My dream is pouring wine into you
At night My untouched string,
I haven't touched you
My dream is pouring wine into you
At night"
Duett,"Day is turning to evening, is gone, soon forgotten
But what we gave remains, a seed will grow and sprout Such is love's way when it strikes you and me
Only when we learn and understand, it will ripen and be ours Though the days pass by, vanishing, becoming years
Love will always remain, for ever and eternity
For eternity The river smoothly flows, through meadows, plains and woods
But on its way to reach its goal, it passes stony rapids Though the days pass by, vanishing, becoming years
Love will always remain, for ever and eternity
For eternity Though the days pass by, vanishing, becoming years
Love will always remain, for ever and eternity
For eternity Love will always remain, for ever and eternity
For eternity"
Ostani kraj mene,"My lonesome soul
Always alone
Without anyone understanding your suffering,
Your horrible suffering Imitating an existence that's always full
Of joy and pleasure
Of joy and pleasure If I were to find a soul like mine,
how many secret things would I tell it?
A soul that looks at me, without saying a thing
It would tell me something with only a look A soul that would get me drunk with a slow breath
That, to kiss me, it would feel what I feel
And sometimes I ask myself what would happen
If I were to find a soul like mine A soul that looks at me, without saying a thing
It would tell me something with only a look A soul that would get me drunk with a slow breath
That, to kiss me, it would feel what I feel
And sometimes I ask myself what would happen
If I were to find a soul like mine"
To trehandiri (Diri diri) (Το τρεχαντήρι (Ντίρι ντίρι)),"We had so much dreams we both the clever ones
but maybe we didn't know waht future will bring
we struggled with time and we believed in tomorrow
we marked the dream but we lost the target Where were you, where were you my little bee
last night, last night that I wanted you
to take from my pollen
you're the fair of my ecstasy Where were you my little bee, the night that I wanted you
to take from my pollen my passion's alarm clock
Oh little bee, little bee, you went to another flower
who know where are you sleeping, in which hug you are How many times we quarelled and we meet gain
we gave in our passion at the time of need
How many times we tried nad tried again
but slowly we put out love's flame"
Für den Frieden der Welt,"Words that hurt and pictures that scream
Flying flags in the wind
Frontiers that lies and nobody knows anymore
And people almost blinded by tears Sometimes I hear a song deep in me
That tells me about love
Longing for freedom and for a world
Where everybody understands each other For the peace of the world, for the hope for light
For the truth that nobody sees anymore
For the people that are cold and that nobody hears anymore
For them I sing you this song For the peace of the world, for the hope for light
For the truth that nobody sees anymore
For the people that are cold and that nobody hears anymore
For them I sing you this song
For them I sing you this song Entreating hearts in the darkness of the night
When will they see light again?
Who will give the laughter back to the children
Before their hope is broken? For the peace of the world, for the hope for light
For the truth that nobody sees anymore
For the people that are cold and that nobody hears anymore
For them I sing you this song And it can’t still be
That you need courage
To show love to others For the peace of the world, for the hope for light
For the truth that nobody sees anymore
For the people that are cold and that nobody hears anymore
For them I sing you this song
Ah… this song"
Ella no es ella,"When I am with her
I am a maze of indecisions
When I am with her
I play with my imagination
She smiles at me
And me, being in a rush, I tend to drown
And I say let´s end
And she pursues my moments of fire She, she is not she
She is the other, the one that drives me
And in my memory
The other is the one I can never forget No, she, she is not she
She is the other, the one that excites me
And burns my clothes
The other is the stone and I the volcano When I am with her
I know all will be worse
And when I think of the other
I become almost, almost God
She brings the moon down to me
And the other wakes up my animal instinct
The other is my fortune
My naked muse, my best remedy She, she is not she
She is the other, the one that drives me
And in my memory
The other is the one I can never forget No, she, she is not she
She is the other, the one that excites me
The other is the stone and I the volcano"
Kinek mondjam el vétkeimet?,"There is nothing, just the lightless night
Just speechless sorrow, just illusive hope
There is no loyalty, no love
There's no caressing hand for me To whom can I tell my sins?
And from whom should I seek forgiveness?
To whom can I tell my sins, God? The night is cold, but I long for light
Like the swift pair escaping to south
My body's merely but a chilling dream
But my soul is a resting fire bird To whom can I tell my sins?
And from whom should I seek forgiveness?
To whom can I tell my sins, God? Don't torture me
Since I'm standing bare in front of you
With blindfolded eyes
God, tell me why I cry without tears
My unborn child How can I tell my sins?
And from whom should I seek forgiveness?
To whom can I tell my sins?
With my sins I have to live
From whom should I seek forgiveness?
To whom can I tell my sins, God?"

 “But the house is empty without you”
In this house there is just me Eternal wanderer, I’m your destiny

with you even a  break up is more passionate than anything
there's still a light in your window, the lighthouse that doesen't fade
I don't  know who created me this way that I'm loosing everything worthy When you light up the stars on the sky, silence starts singing
I miss you so much, did you know that?
I don't care for anything, and my life fades away

Gold and platinum will have no value
I’m a millionaire when you are with me
Laughter and crying unites
Ooh… yeah yeah yeah yeah…
Make a clown out of me, you acrobat without rope
Fly with me through time
Let’s build a house out of daydreams
Truth or false, no problems around
Every norm is the same to me
And madness becomes normal, becomes normal…
(The old world turns the wrong way)
Ah… be light like a feather and float away
Gold and platinum will have no value
I’m a millionaire, and live on it
The old world turns the wrong way
Be light like a feather when I’m with you
Laughter and crying united
Yeah yeah yeah…
The world turns the wrong way

Vuelve conmigo,"I've felt the emptiness
And a sleeping memory arouses again
You're not with me
And so much loneliness is hurting me inside
Who knows where you are?
Who knows where you are? Come, come, come back to me
Come, come, because I need your love
Come, I can't forget you
Come back to me, my love Nothing remains in my soul
Except for this flame that will never die
That burns in my chest
When, alone in my bed
I feel you're not there
You have to listen to me
You have to listen to me Come, come, come back to me
Come, come, because I need your love
Come, come back to me
Give heat to this winter Come, come, come back to me
Come, come, I've already asked your forgiveness
(Come) Come, I can't forget you
Come back to me, my love Oh... (Come, come, come back to me)

Nostalgija,"Silent – a silent violin is playing
And touching my heart’s chords
Through seas and mountains
Tt plays to me, it plays

Paganini plays from the sky
It plays to me, it plays
Nostalgia, nostalgia travels through my soul
It bound me with you my entire life
When you’re away, she’s my home and family

Il me donne rendez-vous,"His three bouquets of flowers at my front door
A poem that he writes for me like the lyrics to a song
His voice on the answering machine just before four AM
Telling me: ""My sweetheart, I'm sending you kisses, everything is fine"" I'm waiting for him a bit like a thief is waiting for the right time
I imagine this man is a tomcat or a charmer He's asking me out, often he tells me
""Allow me, miss""
""To give you a kiss on the neck, some jewellery""
""Something eternal"" He's asking me out, so I admit to him
That I feel like growing wings
And the good lord is jealous of this slightly crazy angel
That makes me believe in heaven He's asking me out as if he were offering me his life
Never before I had addressed a man formally It's a plane ticket to the Marquise Islands
Because I had said no to New York and Venice
It's a big limousine that's waiting down at the lift
He's even able to dress up as a driver He's a bit dandy, a bit roguish, a bit crazy
And I, as it's said, follow his lead1 He's asking me out, often he tells me
""Allow me, miss""
""To give you a kiss on the neck, some jewellery""
""Something eternal"" He's asking me out, so I admit to him
That I feel like growing wings
And the good lord is jealous of this slightly crazy angel
That makes me believe in heaven He's asking me out as if he were offering me his life
Never before I had addressed a man formally He's asking me out, often he tells me

There are faces under the twilight
I'm looking maybe you came But I'm already scared to
You can stand anywhere, you disapear in the crowd

When will I have a second chance Yesterday some friends of mine
Said some words about you
You are over it the hard times
When everything was the same We already had been called
But on the old number what I knew
Either somebody or nobody answered
Do you live somewhere else, or do you live with some other person?

Love City Groove,"We're really makin'
We're really makin'
We're really makin'
We're really makin'
We're really makin'
We're really makin'
We're really makin' love now

Yeah, baby, you know how I be feelin'
Yeah, baby, you know how I be feelin'

Baby, baby, baby, you got me goin' crazy
I'm feelin' kinda high, my mind is gettin' hazy
But when I think of you, I know just what to do
You make me feel so happy when I'm feelin' blue

You're pickin' me up with a kiss, a touch o' your hand
You're all that I want, you're everythin' I planned
Like a fairy tale story, you're the man o' my dreams
My knight in shining armour, well, that's how it seems

You greet me in the morning with a kiss and a smile
And for all the rest of the day I'm on cloud-nine
It may sound like fantasy, but to me, it's real
And I could trust my emotions 'cause I know what I feel

What we have is special, and that it will last
Our hearts beat as one, it's pumpin' blood real fast
'Cause the connection is truly from above
And I thank God

In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body
I know we're really makin' love now
In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body
I know we're really makin' love now

Now baby, baby, when I first saw your face
I saw you had flavour and I wanted a taste of this sweet thing
But now there's so much more
'Cause everyday I'm thinkin' about what my baby has in store

Trust and believe, day to day, you never doubt her
'Cause I used to have a dream girl, but now I found her
And she's by my side, she's my pride, my all
Ten foot tall, that's how I feel, I never fall, I never fell

Oh, what the hell, I'll admit it, love was the target and you hit it
So as I watch you sleep in the middle of the night
You open your eyes and I know it's so right

Two hearts, two minds, two people, one love
And the way you're makin' me feel, it's like you're sent from up above
Your touch, your smell, your face, a unique breed
It's only love but it's all that I need

In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body
I know we're really makin' love now
In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body
I know we're really makin' love now
In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body
I know we're really makin' love now

We're really makin'
We're really makin'
We're really makin'
We're really makin'
We're really makin'
We're really makin'
We're really makin' love now

I'm glad that I been found, always wanted you around
Keepin' me lost for words, yeah, I know how that sounds
Now I been to many places and I seen many things
But nothin' that I know can ever make my heart sing like you do
It's like a voodoo, you know what I'm sayin'?
Baby girl, I ain't playin'
I'm glad that I'm one to rock your world
'Cause honey - yeah...

In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body
I know we're really makin' love now
In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body
I know we're really makin' love now
In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body
I know we're really makin' love now
In the mornin' when the sun shines down on your body

Baunilha e chocolate,"Vanilla and chocolate
Who are these people, yours and mine
Whom had spread roots wherever they went?
They changed the sea, they changed the sky
Where there was no dawn
They made the world their country
Your grandfather was in these parts
My grandmother was here too
Our love is the entire ocean
Your perfume is moonlight
My taste is coffee
My sweetheart with white skin
You are the cream in my dark tea
It's sweeter than honey
A mixture of vanilla and chocolate
A white seagull was found
In those southern lands
Sweet and musical people
Whose tropical singing
Made the dream and the sea blue
Who flavoured our love
Made by the Spanish and Portuguese guitar
In the to-and-fro of caravels
With pepper and cinnamon
With chilli and saffron?
My sweetheart with white skin
You are the cream in my dark tea
It's sweeter than honey
A mixture of vanilla and chocolate
Who were those people who lifted anchor
And rounded Cape Bojador?
Those people who fell under the spell, the challenge
To invent a new love
When hands are joined, a flower is born
And each kiss is blissful peace
When our souls feel love
Whatever the colour of our body
Black or white is of no importance
When our souls feel love
Whatever the colour of our body
Black or white is of no importance"
Sti fotia (Στη φωτιά),"I start my path with a shout
And I take my hand to the fire
Wise men’s prophecies
Told me that I would be pierced with pins
With my grey uniform I learnt
To love the Holy God
I change the truth
And I walk ahead strongly
And I don’t believe yet (I do not stop)
I changed the rules (I will find reasons)
I’m the Greek who fights (Fights)
They said I lost my way (I do not stop)
They opened me paths (I will find reasons)
I remained alone, but I lived again, I lived in the fire
The fire which burns my soul
It’s always about to be extinguished
By a bitter honey
Which falls like rain
But I went ahead (I do not stop)
I didn’t listen to their words (I will find reasons)
I’m the Greek who goes ahead (Goes ahead)

Keep Me in Mind,"That old feeling, dreams we shared together
Are just fragments of the past
There’s a silence, shades of stormy weather
Was our love too good to last?

Light a candle, sing a song
Look for rainbows, there’s nothing wrong
Every night I cry my heart out
‘Cause we’re driftin’ apart, now I know

Keep me in mind when you’re all alone
Dial my number, I’ll wait by the phone
We’ll have tomorrow and sweet dreams to follow
Hold me forever, so keep me in mind, love
‘Cause you’re in my heart

A sweet memory from a world of laughter
Brings back echoes night and day

Light a candle, sing a song
Look for a rainbow, there’s nothing wrong
Every night I cry my heart out
‘Cause we’re driftin’ apart, now I know

Keep me in mind when you’re all alone
Dial my number, I’ll wait by the phone
Send me some lovin’ and take me to heaven
Put love on the line, just make it known that you’re mine

Keep me in mind when dark shadows fall
Don’t go to strangers, I’m there when you call
We’ll have tomorrow and sweet dreams to follow
Hold me forever, so keep me in mind, love
‘Cause you’re in my heart

(‘Cause you’re in my heart)
‘Cause you’re in my heart
(‘Cause you’re in my heart)

If one is tired, says goodbye to tiredness6. Corridinho7 started to run,
A well-performed and hopping dance.
Just play the funaná5and the malhão8 vigorously

We cry the morna5 and play the sapateia15.
The door is always open to welcome everyone
Because we like when our house is full of people. Let's dance the bailinho16,
Bring the sanfona17 and the cavaquinho18.
Chula19 will be danced and the baião2 too

In a Woman's Heart,"Like a circle goin' round in my mind
Forever searchin' an answer I can't find
Strange attraction - man, you weave it so well
Pure fascination, I'm under your spell

Here I go again ignoring my senses
Nothing stops this love, and only a fool will tell

In a woman's heart, a dream is for life any day
In a woman's heart, together's an evening prayer
As I think of you, I'm wonderin' what halved us apart
There you go again forsakin' a woman's heart

Once you promised, seemed so true and sincere
Like rhymin' verses, sweet words rang in my ear
It ain't easy on tough moments like these
No pride can save me, I'm down on my knees

I can't free myself, I wasted my chances
Knockin' on your door, just let me in, hear my plea

In a woman's heart, a dream is for life any day
In a woman's heart, together's an evening prayer
As I think of you, I'm hopin' once more for a start
Every now and then you're breakin' a woman's heart

'Cause I know you're leavin'
(I know you're leavin')
Mmm, out of a woman's heart
Just keep right on heavin'
Beatin' for love that fell apart

There you go again

Mon cœur l'aime,"Alone today, I'm looking at my life
That keeps passing by over the course of my nights
Sometimes I feel selfish and lost
Overly sad I sent him away
Like a long battle that I wanted to win
I thought it was a good idea to hold out, to not hold him back
Today, I don't have as many tears as I want to cry My heart loves him, if I think about it
I'm keeping up appearances in vain
May he take me with him, even far away
I'll give him my hand He stole too many tears from me
In return, he left me his soul
But I'll wait for him to come back
To start everything anew And I used to believe that everything was roses
Like the blue of his magical glance
That there was nothing to do but to smile at him
And to lie to him to be his I sent him away
Like a long battle that I wanted to win
I thought it was a good idea to hold out, to not hold him back
Today, I don't have as many tears as I want to cry My heart loves him, if I think about it
I'm keeping up appearances in vain
May he take me with him, even far away
I'll give him my hand He stole too many tears from me
In return, he left me his soul
But I'll wait for him to come back
To start everything anew My heart loves him, if I think about it

As if they were beloved films
Embrace my thoughts, and guess my words
As if you knew everything I wanted to say
And everything we’ve been taught can just persist
And everything we’ve been taught can just wait
We solve the difficult problems at night
We find new lovers on Sundays
We wear spring clothes in winter time, winter time
Put your head on my shoulder, make my fears go away
As if you were a special trick
Paint the day that is coming, and put on the radio
A song about love
And everything we’ve been taught can just persist
And everything we’ve been taught can just wait
We solve the difficult problems at night
We find new lovers on Sundays

You try to catch my thoughts

Again I must feel like a stranger
beside you.
Sometimes I wait for you, sometimes I flee.
But I need you, you know, i need you. For you see how big my wish
to still be together is, to sill be together.
Why don't you believe me?
For you see how hotly I look at you
Keep waiting for me, keep waiting for me.
Why are you leaving? I leave it all, I close myself inside from you,
it all repeats again.
Past depresses you,
it's like the earth is burning under your feet,
as if someone is waving a web around me,
[a web] that I'll never get free from.
I'll give you half of this pain
because I need you, you know, I need you. For you see how big my wish

For you see how hotly I look at you
Keep waiting for me, keep waiting for me.

I evighet,"Day is turning to evening, is gone, soon forgotten
But what we gave remains, a seed will grow and sprout Such is love's way when it strikes you and me
Only when we learn and understand, it will ripen and be ours Though the days pass by, vanishing, becoming years
Love will always remain, for ever and eternity
For eternity The river smoothly flows, through meadows, plains and woods
But on its way to reach its goal, it passes stony rapids Though the days pass by, vanishing, becoming years
Love will always remain, for ever and eternity
For eternity Though the days pass by, vanishing, becoming years
Love will always remain, for ever and eternity
For eternity Love will always remain, for ever and eternity
For eternity"

The nightfall and the light of day
Give me courage
I’m afraid for our future
The wisdom of the country people
Warms your hearts
And the slopes awaken them
On the lands around the black lake
Flourish, children The hard struggles, the agreement
You speak such honest words
And I find your ways so beautiful
You shout the language
That I miss, alas
Flourish, happy children
The mountains are jaundiced
With nostalgia for the bygone festivals
Between your two lips lies the truth
Flourish, children Wet are your eyes from laughter
And silent are your sorrows
Flourish, children Flourish, children
The hard struggles, the agreement
You speak such honest words
And I find your ways so beautiful
You shout the language
That I miss, alas"

That will last forever
A heartbeat leads me to the place
Where love is real
And if someone steals my love
Steals my heart

For those wild hands
I was just upset Even though I saw you standing with others
Even though you ran off with them
I wanted to and would get you
Run you through with my sword
Although I was playing with fire Love is a cardgame with jokers and pokers
Love is a match of giving and taking
Love is a cardgame of queens and kings
Love is a game of chance for winners just like you Passion won from tenderness
Fury from cosiness
Did you want to devour me
Without committing yourself?
You'll never get rid of me again Even though you like to go your own way
Leaving you doesn't scare me anymore
I want to and will get you
Run you through with my sword
Although I'm still playing with fire Love is a cardgame with jokers and pokers
Love is a match of giving and taking
Love is a cardgame of queens and kings

The Voice,"I hear your voice on the wind
And I hear you call out my name

""Listen my child,"" You say to me,""I am the voice of your history
'Be not afraid come follow me. Answer my call and I'll set you free.""

I am the voice in the wind and the pouring rain
I am the voice of your hunger and pain
I am the voice that always is calling you
I am the voice, I will remain

I am the voice in the fields when the summer's gone;
The dance of the leaves when the Autumn winds blow
Ne'er do I sleep throughout all the cold Winter long
I am the force that in Springtime will grow

I am the voice of the past that will always be;
Filled with my sorrows and blood in my fields
I am the voice of the future
Bring me your peace
Bring me your peace and my wounds they will heal

I am the voice in the wind and the pouring rain
I am the voice of your hunger and pain
I am the voice that always is calling you
I am the voice

I am the voice of the past that will always be
I am the voice of your hunger and pain
I am the voice of the future
I am the voice
I am the voice
I am the voice
I am the voice"

Den vilda,"The winter is lowering its veil and is tucking in the houses
The fire in the tavern warms us and the food and the jugs
There he dances with the wild one
They are dancing like whirls in a waterfall
Filled with pride and willpower
Dancing like whirls in a waterfall But rumours are spreading among the cottages
While snowflakes are falling
The stars are sparkling against the ice like clear crystals
There he runs away with the wild one
They are rushing like whirls in a waterfall
Filled with pride and willpower
Rushing like whirls in a waterfall The carriage is disappearing in the night
And the snow becomes snowdrifts along the road
The sound of hoofs are still echoing in the mountains
Playing carefreely like a waterfall The night is lowering its veil and erasing the traces
Wherever they are, they're strong like the stream in springtime
There he dances with the wild one
They are dancing like whirls in a waterfall
Filled with pride and willpower
Dancing like whirls in a waterfall Filled with pride and willpower
Dancing like whirls in a waterfall"

Made me wish that I could share one moment of your life

Mysterious woman, I wonder, did you see
The kind of spell you put on me?
Mysterious woman, I wish I could find the key
To the kind of spell you put on me

The room was full of faces but you stood out from the crowd
People going places far away beyond the clouds
Were you from the streets of Paris, or the coast of Italy?
Or were you from as far away as the gulf of Araby?

Mysterious woman, I wonder, did you see
The kind of spell you put on me?
Mysterious woman, I wish I could find the key
To the kind of spell you put on me

Did I imagine you smiled
Or were my thoughts going wild?

Suddenly you were going, the speaker called your plane
There was no way of knowing if I'd ever see you again
But this brief, so brief encounter will always stay with me
I will always treasure the bittersweet memory

Mysterious woman, I wonder, did you see
The kind of spell you put on me?
Mysterious woman, it'll always be a mystery
The kind of spell you put on me"

''Good fairies, where are those lips""
""That are magic when lovers kiss?'' Wake up, good prince

Only the time to hurry up
No, no one has time anymore
Only to think about himself No, no, no one has time anymore
No one has time anymore You don’t understand anything of the world
The time is expensive, because time is money
Standing still is out of the question
So tempo, that’s what matters Although the people are still giving
They don’t linger over their feelings
By computer they can quickly
Deposit something for the good cause Because no one has time anymore
Only the time to hurry up
No, no one has time anymore
Only to think about himself No, no, no one has time anymore
No one has time anymore No one has time anymore
No one has time anymore

No one, no, no Will we ever realise
There’s much more than the factor time?
Stand still for a moment, give in to the temptation
To have some more sensitivity Because no one has time anymore
Only the time to hurry up
No, no one has time anymore
Only to think about himself No, no, no one has time anymore

It was wonderful to spend
Those unforgettable, happy days
Our flame dies out, our love dies out
But our heart will always feel… That you’re someone special
That no one will be the same
That’s why I ask you That there won’t be any grudge if we meet again, love
There were so many happy days
You gave me so much love
Swear it to me, without a grudge I wish you all the best
May the things we learnt help us both
Goodbye, sweetheart, you know that
I’ll feel for you… That you’re someone special
That no one will be the same
That’s why I ask you That there won’t be any grudge if we meet again, love
There were so many happy days
You gave me so much love
Just swear to me, please May there never be grudge if we meet again, love
There’ll always be something special between you and me
That between us both everything will stay
Without a grudge, without a grudge If you search for a friend
I’ll be by your side Between you and me
May there never be a grudge
There’ll always be something special between you and me
Without a grudge"
Zeit,"Sometimes, time slipped through my fingers
Sometimes, it just didn't seem to pass by
But time heals many wounds
And in some difficult hours
I dreamt of turning back time, because... Time, time, only where does time go?
Time, time, when's the day?
Who knows what's yet to happen?
Who knows where this road will take me?
Tell me, where are you? Time, time, what else will I have to face
At this time? I prayed for some happiness
And cried over the lost time
But nobody here could give me an answer
To one specific question:
Can we be happy in peace together? No Time, time, only where does time go?
Time, time, when's the day?
Where will I be tomorrow?
Will I end up alone after all?
And where are you? (Time, time, only where does time go?)
Time goes by so fast
(Time, time, when's the day?)
The wind changes so fast Who knows what's yet to happen?
Who knows where this road will take us?
Tell me, where are you? Time, time, no matter how long this road is
To walk it, I only need
A little time"
Ale jestem,"I open my eyes: the world becomes
Heaven above me, in front of me - an orchard
The fragrance of green apples and their taste
And everything so simple like this. You have to truly live,
to cheat time.
You have to live as beautifully as possible,
You only live once.
You have to live in awe:
Dream, love and dream*
You have to cheat time
To truly live. I am a grain of sand in an hourglass
A lost little boat among the reefs,
A drop of rain,
A thinking blade in the grass
... but I am! I'm a spark and gust of wind
A streak of light that runs to the stars,
I'm a moment, that wants to overtake time
... but I am! I hold out my ears: I listen to how
the music is playing in me, in the music - me!
Before the great silence engulfs me,
I want to sing out, to sing out that: You have to truly live,
to cheat the racing time.
It's beautiful to live in awe,
Life happens only once. I am a grain of sand in an hourglass
A lost little boat among the reefs,
A drop of rain,
A thinking blade in the grass
... but I am! Life is a way, life is a dream...
And what happens after?... I don't know, and I know...
Don't ask about anything, you'll find out when,
The road will end, life and dreams. I am a grain of sand in an hourglass
A lost little boat among the reefs,
A drop of rain,
A thinking blade in the grass
... but I am! I'm a spark and gust of wind
A streak of light that runs to the stars,
I'm a moment, that wants to overtake time
... but I am!"
Keelatud maa,"Why do you always hide yourself in yesterday?
When you disappear there you’ll stay disappeared
Finding you for the hundredth time already
The flaws between us have become cracks, I see
But if I give up, you’ll be lost for good
On this forbidden land I feel myself again
I’m looking for you and again there’s a border between us
This forbidden land hides you from me like fog
Sometime it will disappear from our way When I can’t find you
And while looking even a day falls short
You may lie down next to me
You won’t recognise me, won’t hear, won’t see
Still I understand you, you linger in yesterday again On this forbidden land I feel myself again
I’m looking for you and again there’s a border between us
This forbidden land hides you from me like fog
Sometime it will disappear from our way I’ll bring you from the forbidden land
I promise you, I will fetch you (This forbidden land, I feel myself again)
 From the forbidden land
(I’m looking for you and again there’s a border between us)
Forbidden land
(This forbidden land)
Can’t keep you
(Can’t keep you forever)
The forbidden land will vanish from between us"
Goodbye,"Calm me down with pictures from good movies
Brave me with a line from good songs
I can't see, my eye's devoid of shine
I only hear the two words, which mean it's over Goodbye, oh oh oh oh oh... goodbye love
Goodbye, oh oh oh oh oh... goodbye love
Goodbye Look for me in your memories
Find me in the dawn of a new day
But please don't sigh falsely
Don't say the two words which mean it's over Goodbye, oh oh oh oh oh... goodbye love
Goodbye, oh oh oh oh oh... goodbye love
Goodbye I can't see, my eye's devoid of shine
Oh... I only hear the two words which mean it's over Goodbye, oh oh oh oh oh... goodbye love

Antes do adeus,"Before our goodbye, the adventure
Before our goodbye, the madness
Before our goodbye, the tenderness
Swear to the moon and to the song of the sea, for Before our goodbye (your verses, your woes), I'll improvise (you could here them all through the street)
Before our goodbye (in the farthest reaches of the wind), in my smile (on the other side of the moon)
Before our goodbye (your dreams were mine), paradise (my life was yours)
We read the signals (before saying goodbye) and were even immortal And at night, a river
Where the sun set
My body, a ship on the tides of your voice
Sounds to the challenge
Reverberating for us
And the morning light was magical Before our goodbye (you returned my poets), the undone (I saw spite in your eyes)
Before our goodbye (there were secret words), the suspicious (on the other side of love)
Before our goodbye (you still hid, you witch), the imperfect (a book by Saramago)
Two-way sharing (an Abrunhosa CD) to be remembered later, but The blue of the sky
Stopped being true
The city's magic perished in a sea of greys
In my eyes, the shadow
Of anxiety was born
And the pain has silenced all the music
(x2) After our goodbye,
the longing"
Bara hon älskar mig,"I saw a girl dancing through the night.
Smiling so all hearts stop.
Though I have walked through fire and water,
She touches me like no other.
And if she falls for me, everything changes.
If she sees that the man she's waiting for,
Is me,
Then maybe it can be her and I. If only she loves me,
I could have the angel that my heaven lacks.
If only she loves me,
I'd become that man in her dreams.
Everyone else has missed out.
She can never love without me. I do not dare to meet her gaze.
See, my heart is burning.
How will I ever get this girl?
I wonder before she disappears.
Though other men would die for her,
I understand that nobody sees,
What she wants.
That it's only me. If only she loves me,
I could have the angel that my heaven lacks,
And the only woman I could ever want.
If only she loves me,
I'd become that man in her dreams.
Everyone else has missed out.
She can never love without me. I have nothing else to live for
Nothing is worth anything until we find each other.
We will become one. If only she loves me,
I could have the angel that my heaven lacks,
And the only woman I could ever want.
If only she loves me,
I'd become that man in her dreams.
Everyone else has missed out.
She can never love without me. If only she loves me,
I'd become that man in her dreams.
She can never love without me."
Horepse (Χόρεψε),"Slowly, slowly
Like the flame's figure, you cast your spells
Shyly, shyly
You close your moon-shaped eyes Dance again to the beat of my heart
And like a caravan I'll follow the stars
Dance, pearl of the desert
And through your body I'll resurrect myself Dance again to the beat of my heart
And like a caravan I'll follow the stars
Dance, pearl of the desert
And through your body I'll resurrect myself Softly, softly
I saw the night melting
Palely, palely
She laid her naked hands upon me Dance again to the beat of my heart
And like a caravan I'll follow the stars
Dance, pearl of the desert
And through your body I'll resurrect myself Dance again to the beat of my heart
And like a caravan I'll follow the stars
Dance, pearl of the desert
And through your body I'll resurrect myself Dance again to the beat of my heart
And like a caravan I'll follow the stars
Dance, pearl of the desert
And through your body I'll resurrect myself"
Let Me Fly,"Each time I hear the music play
It makes me feel that way
The memories we once shared
Come back inside me

And when I hear that same old song
Throughout the whole night long
The pains that we've been through
All fade away

Let me fly and I will reach way up high
I will climb the steps that lead to the sky
Where the clouds caress your face with my tears
Let me try - I can fly

Let me hear the songs that I never played
I will find the keys that open the gate
Of my dreams, which light the flame in my life
If they die, I can't fly

Hahah, hahahah
Hahah, hahah, hahah

And when the music stops to play
The thrill soon fades away
Dark shadows from the past
Will haunt my day

Let me fly and I will reach way up high
I will climb the steps that lead to the sky
Where the clouds caress your face with my tears
Let me try - I can fly

Let me hear the songs that I never played
I will find the keys that open the gate
Of my dreams, which light the flame in my life
If they die, I can't fly

Till I die, let me fly"
"Miért kell, hogy elmenj?","Why do you have to go?
How should I tell you that it was all real
Anything I should ask, you would not reply
You took another road, keep waiting for somebody new
Why do you have to go?
We could start all over
I feel I could do anything for you
A dream escorted me, then ended just like that
How should I tell you that it was all but a feeling
In the still of the night, you can still hear me sigh
All through your dreams, I'd watch over you
Why do you have to go?
We could start all over
I feel I could do anything for you
A dream escorted me, then ended just like that
Why do you have to go?
We could start all over
I feel I could do anything for you

Primadonna (Примадонна),"At the opera, when the diva plays a romantic role
Sad or happy
She is always 20 years old, eternally
The maestro conducts, Prima Donna
The orchestra that follows you, Prima Donna
As one follows a woman And the audience is conquered, Prima Donna
The audience applauds you, Prima Donna
And required this woman who ignites But in the life of a dive, the man that she loves does not love her
Because he loves a 20 year old singer in the chorus
That breaks her heart Poor Pagliacci in tears, Prima Donna
Laugh through the pain, Prima Donna Sing or shout if you believe, Prima Donna
Sing while wearing your cross, Prima Donna
Jealousy that grips you
That tears out your guts Sing like you never have, never performed as a singer
For the man that you loved, sing as an injured woman, go and sing
The audience cries out Encore, give them all of yourself
Your voice, your tears, your body, make them love again Sing! Primadonna! Encore! Encore!"

""Yes, hello, this is Kaj, may I talk to that sweet one?""
""What sweet one?""
""Well the voice of my life"" (You tun me on and I can't reach you cause)
(You're so far from me) I feel lonely because I miss someone
To share my life with, it's becoming a problem
I call you up, but can't get the words out
When I get enough nerve up, well the receiver has been put down It's two o'clock, I've tried several times
I can't reach you, the answer remains the same
Why are you gone, when I'm right here?
Why am I alone? I feel so weird I overshoot the mark, every time I think I am aiming
I feel so certain, but the contact between us fails
Feel like shit, I get drunk
All this to forget you and your voice (You turn me on and I can't reach you) Cause
(You're so far from me) You're the voice of my life
(I call you up, wish I could see you) Cause
(You're so far from me) Yeah, you're the voice of my life I got fired from my job for calling during working hours
It couldn't stop me, I had to hear you all the time
Ever since then my mobile bill has increased
I own people money, and my life is kind of falling apart Even though I'm well raised I can't help myself
The phone is near by, the number cause me no trouble
To remember, cause it's just one, one and eight
Didn't talk to you today, wish I had the time First it was Molly, then it was Lone, then it was Lis
Then it was Mette, then it was Helle, then it was Kis
But the girl I wanted to talk to wasn't by the phone
I called about twenty times, thought I had run out of luck Cause just one single answer could safe my day
But there are no bright hopes, not the answer I want
In the end I collapsed with the phone in my hand
With the dream of you, your voice in spirit (You turn me on) Yeah (and I can't reach you) Cause
(You're so far from me) You're the voice of my life
(I call you up, wish I could see you) Cause
(You're so far from me) Yeah, you're the voice of my life However I must pull myself together, friend
Grab my phone and try again
I pressed one, one, eight, wishing, hoping
""This is the Telephone Information Service"", and I was baffled ""Hi, it's Kaj, you...""
""You have called the Telephone Information Service,
At he moment there is a brief waiting period for about 20 seconds
The waiting period is free""
""I love you"" (You turn me on and I can't reach you) Cause
(You're so far from me) You're the voice of my life
(I call you up, wish I could see you) Cause
(You're so far from me) Yeah, you're the voice of my life (You turn me on)"
Sentiments songes,"Often, we ride the roundabout in the wrong direction
We discover love, but without the fine manners
We  make up stories to get high
We mask our memory to avoid all thoughts It's like the water in a river, it flows 	incessantly
Everything we had once found beautiful got broken over time
It doesn't really hurt, we only feel left out
Of the starlight and we don't want to give anymore Feelings, useful dream feelings
Suitable for fragile words of love
Feelings, sentimental sufferings
As light as a hush
A game of tears for sleepless nights Affectionate assumptions
Oh... It's like the weapon at a crime scene, we need the fingerprint to prove
To prove whether we were good or bad to each other
We display everything that is ugly
Nobody remembers what was good And this creates strangely precise memories
Things we can write down or tidy up in our lives
We don't really know anymore what is wrong and what is right
But what really matters is that we've done all this Feelings, useful dream feelings
Suitable for fragile words of love
Feelings, sentimental sufferings
As light as a hush
A game of tears for sleepless nights Oh, feelings"

Minn hinsti dans,"London, Paris, Rome became empty words
I walked the wide and golden road, blinded by love
False acquaintances, revolved around me alone
I had some caviar, it’s all too late now
For I take my final dance
And bid my life farewell in style
Yet I never regret a thing
Never regret Crystal champagne, pearls, porcelain
Diamonds for dinner, love for dessert
If I love today, it will be in the papers tomorrow
I take a bubblebath, drown my sorrows And I take my final dance
And that’s how I bid my life farewell in style
Yet I never regret a thing
Never regret All that I get today, has gone away tomorrow So I take my final dance
And that’s how I bid my life farewell in style
Yet I never regret a thing
Never regret"
Neka mi ne svane,"One more day has passed
Once more the moon appeared on the sky
Silently as some dear guest
To be my bridge to the morning
Because sadness leads me through the years
And steals my sleep, until the new day comes for me. May the dawn never come to me
May I disappear, may I cease to exist
May they never wake me up without you
May the dawn never come to me
May I disappear, may I cease to exist
May they never wake me up without you"

In the night, in the night

In the roads of your imagination
Even if I wake up from your touch
In the darkness of your soul I’m always going to die

Guildo hat euch lieb!,"Guildo loves you!

So even if there are tears
He'll come over and sing songs for you
Guildo loves you
There was once a time, a time of tenderness
When Caressing and Cuddling and Loving
Were always written with capitals
I like to think back
On those days full of harmony and luck
When I daily wrote in a poetry book:
Yoo hoo hoo – I love you
Guildo loves you
So even if there are tears
He'll come over and sing songs for you
Guildo loves you (again and again)
In my little world, where we all stick together
And where tears don't lie
Dreams will learn to fly
That's where I'd like to be
If the stars weren't so far away
And from there I'd send you the proof of my love:
Nut cookies and raspberry ice cream
Guildo loves you
So even if there are tears
He'll come over and sing songs for you
Guildo loves you (again and again)
I like to look back
On those days full of harmony and luck
When I daily wrote in a poetry book:
Yoo hoo hoo – I love you
Guildo loves you
So even if there are tears
He'll come over and sing songs for you
Guildo loves you (again and again, again and again)
(Guildo loves us, again and again)
Whoa... Guildo loves you (again and again)
(Guildo loves us, again and again)
Hey, Guildo loves you"
The One That I Love,"Such a lovely night
When the stars are shining bright
And you're near, we're all alone
Cause I long for you so much
I never felt this way, not before
You turn on my mind, more and more

Chorus:
I think that I'm in love
And you mean so much to me
I think I love you so
I'll never let you go
This must be love
Up there we seem to flow
I'm standing and now I know;
For me yes, you're just the one
The one that I love

Such a lovely sight
When the colours shine so bright
And you're near, we're all alone
And I feel so warm inside
I never felt this way all my life
You came like spring sunshine
Gave me life

Chorus:
I think that I'm in love
And you mean so much to me
I think I love you so
I'll never let you go
This must be love
Up there we seem to flow
I'm standing and now I know;
For me yes, you're just the one
The one that I love

For me as you're just the one;
The one that I love"
A holnap már nem lesz szomorú,"Sadness will be over tomorrow
Look, another picture has been found
I had thought it had been lost for long
You're sitting on a terrace
The sun is going down, and it's about to rain
In the background there are the sea and the bustling harbour
There was always music in the streets at night
Let's go some day and see if it's still the same
Ignore what the doctor says, it's rubbish
I know you'll get better again
I'm taking care of you
And you'll dance like in the past
And people will stare and ask who this girl may be
She's so beautiful, we must have fallen asleep and be dreaming
And if the heavenly pilgrim
Is not so hard after all
Sadness will be over tomorrow
It's all right, dear, throughout the years
The world has shown us so many of its different faces
You've always been so brave, braver than giving up hope
I know you'll get better again
Don't be afraid
And you'll dance like in the past
And people will stare and ask who this girl may be
She's so beautiful, we must have fallen asleep and be dreaming
And if the heavenly pilgrim
Is not so hard after all
Sadness will be over tomorrow
Sadness will be over tomorrow
Sadness will be over tomorrow"
Naj bogovi slišijo,"All there is left for me
Are a few memories and hope
Her picture in front of my eyes
Never fades, it just shines I’ll wait for her for a thousand years (I’ll wait for you)
I’ll be begging on my knees (I’ll be begging you)
Let someone have mercy
I’ll scream to the sky I love her Let the gods hear
That I’m in pain
Save me
No, I can’t be without her
My heart is dying Let someone have mercy
I’ll scream to the sky I love her Let the gods hear
That I’m in pain
Save me
No, I can’t be without her Oh… (Let the gods hear)

Is Always Over Now?,"You were the one – my love, my friend
You were my every dream come true
Always, you said, was me and you
So how can you say it’s over now?
How can you wave it all goodbye?
Always, you said, this love would be
Always, you said, was you and me
Is always over now?
Does it never last that long?
Were the feelings that I had
Ever right, or was it wrong?
To think that love should last
Was mistaken on my part
But you promised me the earth (You promised me)
And you only broke my heart
You touched my soul, you touched my life
You always would, you said
But now, you are taking always away
Is always over now?
Does it never last that long?
Were the feelings that I had
Ever right, or was it wrong?
To think that love should last
Was mistaken on my part
But you promised me the earth (You promised me)
And you only broke my heart

Motherland and fatherland
That distance makes you cry Sailing, sailing
Over land and over sea

There is a Portuguese
Longing for someone who left someone
On the other side of the sea If I could embrace you
And talk to you after

Eu cred,"I, I'm still waiting for you
I think it's unfair
that only the memory of when you were here remains.
I feel
that you're always around,
The thought and the feeling that you protect me,
that you encourage me. (chorus)
I believe you are listening to me,
I believe you don't forget,
to give me a sign from heaven,
to say that you're staying a little more.
If I could
reach your world,
I would call you back,
I believe in us. Maybe I am wrong,
I can't look up
to the stars,
And find you there
You only come in my dream,
like this, because you promised me.
We always remain good friends,
Good friends. (chorus) Sometimes I feel
How you are watching me,
I want you to know:
That you only bring me serenity. (chorus)"
Where Are You?,"I see a picture in a frame
I see a face without a name
Riding alone on an empty train
Where are you

I live in a house of broken hearts
Leaves are falling in the park
Every day is a question mark
Where are you

I would drive through the rain (to find you)
Walk a desert plain (behind you)
You could unlock these chains (I'm tied to)
Where are you now

Through the storm I call your name (to guide you)
Love could be the flame (beside you)
If you unlock these chains (I'm tied to)
Where are you now

Lying in my room at night
Silhouettes are dressed in white
Waiting for the morning light
Where are you

Each day you live and learn
As the wheels of heaven turn
For you my candle burns
Where are you

I would drive through the rain (to find you)
Walk a desert plain (behind you)
You could unlock these chains (I'm tied to)
Where are you now

Through the storm I call your name (to guide you)
Love could be the flame (beside you)
If you unlock these chains (I'm tied to)
Where are you now

(So near) so near, (so far) so far
Out there, I can almost touch you
You're here in my mind all the time
Where are you now

(I would drive through the rain) to find you
Walk a desert plain (behind you)
You could unlock these chains (I'm tied to)
Where are you now

Through the storm (through the storm) I call your name (to guide you)
Love could be the flame (beside you)

Genesis (Γένεσις),"Strange and peculiar love
Hope on the dance of the wind
Beautiful goddess at the crossroads
Of ancient omnipotent races
In the mouths of your people, little homeland
You have placed a formidable word
I know, holding firm somewhere inside you
Is that boundless, global virtue

Resurrection of light, spring’s dance of freedom

The primordial cry, the celebration of youth and freedom

At the sunset of the century, an illusion
Arises, separates, divides
But another truth unites us

Hemel en aarde,"The Netherlands were cool and chilly, and especially the weather
The wind, it never fell, my love life all the more
What I read in your eyes lightened my fire
It’s quite often underrated, the force of nature Heaven and earth are moving when you’re in front of me
For me it’s proven that fate exists
Heaven and earth are opening when you touch me
I never wanted to believe, but there’s more
Between heaven and earth Black skies are breaking open on the horizon
Now I’ll warm myself by the rays of the sun (Rays of the sun)
I’ve tried love, it was never what it seemed
But I saw the future when I looked into your eyes Heaven and earth are moving when you’re in front of me
For me it’s proven that fate exists

I never wanted to believe, but there’s more (Heaven and earth are moving) When you’re in front of me
(For me it’s proven) Oh, that fate exists
Heaven and earth are opening when you touch me

Kärleken är,"Here, in the quiet dawn,
I know that everything breathes again.
The heavy clouds,
Ran away with the wind.
No tears from the sky,
Will become rain.
We hear the words from a song, which
Will stay here in our hearts,
Now, in the calm after the storm. An angel passed,
In heaven, so free.
But she left her smile,
On our earth.
Like a sun that keeps us warm,
Like a celestial starlight,
So that we can consider what happens in life,
With faith,
Love is. And when night falls,
We are safe in each other's breath.
A wind that sneaks in here,
Wearing a fragrance made from wild roses. An angel passed,
In heaven, so free.
But she left her smile,
On our earth.
Like a sun that keeps us warm,
Like a celestial starlight,
So that we can consider what happens in life,
With faith,
Love is. Oohh... Aahhh... Ohh An angel passed,
In heaven, so free.
But she left her smile,
On our earth.
Like a sun that keeps us warm,
Like a celestial starlight,
So that we can consider what happens in life,
With faith,
Love is."

I want to bask in the wood
of your smile
We will fill the space with our bursts of laughter
One day we'll need to be able to leave Say yes
You know the earth is beautiful
Say yes
When you're all alone
And then
The world does it again
Say yes
Come for your whole life, come for an hour
Hold on
Something changed in the morning sky
One would say that the air is more pure
And it's good
You know the key to the future is in our hands
When will you join me?
Say yes
At least we'll go together
Say yes
We are stronger together
And then we're alike
Say yes
I want to learn you by heart You've had enough of these bombs
that explode all around us
You dream of another world
Where money won't settle everything
So don't listen anymore to the ones
that keep telling you we're wrong
You know it's enough just to be ourselves
To believe that we are stronger Come
If you're tired with the emptiness of your love
If you no longer believe in never
or in always
If you want to stop, just to whisper a little
If you believe we can be happy

So our childhood is left behind on the beach
And our journey starts My darling can you understand everything ahead of us is new
Now in the rain, in the wind, in a blaze of the sun
Our bodies, souls and minds on this path
Belong only to each other When space lies before us
No matter if it's charged by the storm
Our dreams and risks are mutual in a whirl of waves My darling can you understand everything ahead of us is new
Now in the rain, in the wind, in a blaze of the sun
Our bodies, souls and minds on this path
Belong only to each other You've got the sheet and I have the rudder in my hand
Our goal binds us together
We've got the same boat in the midst of these winds
Where we can hold only each other My darling can you understand everything ahead of us is new My darling can you understand everything ahead of us is new

When I had forgotten the path to darkness

Don't draw us to sorrow in one breath
If my captivity to you is the only thing that you have left me
Cry my heart, there is a lot of time for the light
Why should our hands
Part our loving eyes?
Didn't our hearts stop beating, when we were apart?
You can't forget even if years pass by
Even if our hair begins to turn grey
No one can make us forget each other

Living My Life Without You,"Living my life without you - can it be true?
Something is missing, baby

Ah yeah... (Oh baby, I know it's you)

Nothing feels the same without your loving
I can't stop the rain or wind from blowing
I search inside my soul, try to recover
But life is not the same without my lover

(Since you went away,) can't sleep
(Since you went away,) can't eat
My world is falling apart, oh baby, baby

Living my life without you - can it be true?
Something is missing, baby
Living my life without you - what can I do?

Defences down and suddenly
All your love comes back to me

And this time I mean it, oh baby
This time I mean it and now
You got me goin' so crazy
Even though I don't know how

Tried it before but we never happened
We just gotta try it again
Well, this time I mean it, oh baby
I'm in love with you again

Oh, I know what was said and done
It's been hard just to carry on
The sweetest love left a bitter taste
Who's to say it was all a waste?

Mmm... 'cause in each quarrel, in every fight
There's a lesson 'bout wrong and right
Oh, looking back, I'm sure to say
That we learned from yesterday

So this time I mean it, oh baby
This time I mean it and now
You got me goin' so crazy
Even though I don't know how

We tried it before but we never happened
We just gotta try it again
Well, this time I mean it, oh baby

I'm in love with you again"

And more than one banner, a smile on our lips
If the walls that separate our souls have fallen
If it's enough to exist to keep the flame burning If it's enough to sing
If it's enough to sing I want to give my voice, I want to give my words
I want to give my faith and my life unconditionally1
I want to give my heart, all the love that is yet to come
Contrive a joy and never die If there is no more war won ab initio
If there are no more barriers, no more differences
If there are no more chains that can't be destroyed
If there is no more hate to hide a smile If it's enough to sing
If it's enough to sing I want to give my voice, I want to give my words
I want to give my faith and my life unconditionally1
I want to give my heart, all the love that is yet to come
Contrive a joy and never die
Never die... Die of it...
I want to give...
I want to give my voice"
One Good Reason,"You know there never was a doubt in my mind
You only have to follow and learn how to read the signs
A heartache always seems so easy to find
But I will never let go, I wanna see what this love has to hide

We'll just have to face it, rearrange and place it
I'll never let love pass us by

Give me one good reason and I will give you two
Say ""I love you forever"", say you will, say you do
Give me one good reason and I will give you two
Say ""I love you forever"", say you will, say ""I do""

You know there never was a cloud in my eye
All we have is one chance to reach out for the clear blue skies
We'll just have to face it, rearrange and place it
I'll never let love pass us by

Give me one good reason and I will give you two
Say ""I love you forever"", say you will, say you do
Give me one good reason and I will give you two
Say ""I love you forever"", say you will, say ""I do""

(And then the heart...)
The heart gets stronger with every step that we take
(From the moment...)
From the moment we go to sleep till the time that we awake

(I won't let...)
I won't let anybody lead us astray
(And then the line...)
And then the line from me to you will never break or fade away

Give me one good reason and I will give you two
I love you forever, yes, I will, baby, I do

Give me one good reason and I will give you two
Say ""I love you forever"", say you will, say you do
Give me one good reason and I will give you two
Say ""I love you forever"", say you will, say ""I do""

Say ""I do"""
Przytul mnie mocno,"Hoo… hoo yeah…
I don’t know who wrote the text of our roles
I don’t know why there’s error, pain and remorse Show me the way to simple words through every day
Show me the way when shadows fall and lights fade Hold me tight and turn the ice into snowflakes
Hold me tight, give me a well of spring waters Till remorse can mend errors, I cherish hope
Till a tear is still a tear, I’m not alone
No, I’m not alone… As long as a tear is still a tear, I’m not alone
Oh no, I’m not alone"
All Out of Luck,"Don't work on a Sunday, don't sleep on a Monday

'Cause you know today won't last forever, tomorrow has a brand new name
I'll give you all that I can offer, the rest is all up to you, yeah

You're all out of luck, if you wanna give up, you've got to let go of all your bad memories
Breakin' it up means bringing it down, you need to get right back on track
'Cause you're all out of luck, if you wanna give up, you've got to believe in yourself
You'll be fine 'cause you'll be mine, so just wake up before it's too late

You're all out of luck, if you wanna give up, you've got to let go of all your bad memories

Tha'ne erotas (Θα'ναι έρωτας),"The moon lights dimly in the city
And if you can bear with the scene
Your eyes have taken two drops
From the morning rain
Take the stars of the sky
Embellish his glance
Touch the flower of the lotus
Call his name, and it will be love
Some star lights dimly in the city
And you remained to live, yes, to live
To the first of your heart’s summer
Into the hugs of Sunday
Take the stars of the sky
Embellish his glance
Touch the flower of the lotus
Call his name
(But don’t ask) It will be love
But don’t ask, it will be love
(Take the stars of the sky)
Embellish his glance
Touch the flower of the lotus
Call his name, and it will be love
It will be love

Take Me to Your Heaven,"[Verse 1]
Shadows dancing slowly on my wall
Moonlight painting silver to the
Sound of heartbeat
Magical emotions take control
Knowing we will meet before the night is over

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I gonna make you mine
Love you till the end of time

[Chorus]
Take me to your heaven
Hold on to a dream
Take me to your heaven
When my nights are cold and lonely
Flying high together
On a journey to the stars
Won't you take me to your heaven, to your heart

[Verse 2]
I can feel your body next to mine
Reaching for a kiss that keeps me warm and tender
Seven steps to heaven, show the way
When I'm there I give myself the sweet surrender

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I gonna make you mine
Love you till the end of time

[Chorus]
Take me to your heaven
Hold on to a dream
Take me to your heaven
When my nights are cold and lonely
Flying high together
On a journey to the stars
Won't you take me to your heaven, to your heart

[Bridge]
As dawn is breaking, there is so much more to say
So will you be my one and only
When nights are lonely
Hold on time forever

[Chorus]
Take me to your heaven
Hold on to a dream
Take me to your heaven
When my nights are cold and lonely
Flying high together
On a journey to the stars
Won't you take me to your heaven, to your heart

[Outro]
(Woah)
Won't you take me to your heaven, to your heart"
Como tudo começou,"Who's going to tell me how it all began?
My life no longer make sense now
I know, there won't be any way to see you
Without me knowing why you went away And without wanting to hurt you, I never knew how to be like
What you imagined for yourself Give me your hand, don't lie anymore
Look that your eyes are crystals
Please don't say you don't go out
Because I always know where you're going There's no more reason to live without the passion
That haunts me and follow me all the time Because, without wanting, I hurt you so much, I never knew how to be like
What you imagined for yourself Give me your hand, don't lie anymore
Look that your eyes are crystals
Please don't say you don't go out
Because I always know where you're going Give me your hand, don't lie anymore
Look that your eyes are crystals
Give me your hand"
When You Need Me,"And you would always be there
In everything I’d do
But the fool that I am
Never tried to understand
When you needed someone
To help you through the rain
But this child inside of me
Never let me feel your pain
And how I’ve let it all just slip away
And now I’m wishing for yesterday
Don’t you go on your own
Don’t leave me here alone
‘Cause I’ll be there, yes, I swear
When you need me I’ll be there
Don’t you go, I’m on my own
Don’t you go
You’ve been my inspiration
All along the way
But I can see it in your eyes
Well, there’s no more yesterday
But I will find my way back
No matter what it takes
For the first time I can see
The love you lost on me
Don’t you go on your own
Don’t leave me here alone
‘Cause I’ll be there, yes, I swear
When you need me I’ll be there
Don’t you go, no, no
And now I’ve let it all just slip away
But the fool, the fool’s inside of me
Don’t you go on your own
Don’t leave me here alone
‘Cause I’ll be there, yes, I swear
When you need me I’ll be there
Don’t you go, I’m on my own
Don’t you go"
Reflection,"Song - Contest`99:
AUSTRIA
Performed by Bobbie Singer
Written by Dave Moskin
When I'm sad
I need a shoulder to cry on
And when I'm bad
You know that I am better
When you're gone
You're the one that I am thinking of
And when I come
It's to you that I run
There's no need to be lonely
I'll be there every time for you
Isn't that the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes memories will have to do
Don't you recognise me
I'm the one that you have seen
The reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes
They say it's long way to heaven
But they are wrong
'cause heaven is you
And if I fall
From grace everlasting
There you are to make everything new
And we can fly forever
Wrap yourself around my emotions
We can only make it better and better
Don't ever think to doubt my devotions
Don't you recognise me
I'm the one that you have seen
The reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes
Don't you recognise me
I'm the one that you have seen
The reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes"

Reise nach Jerusalem – Kudüs'e seyahat,"Journey to Jerusalem
Hi, hi, hand in hand on the journey to Jerusalem
Hi, hi, let's go on the journey to Jerusalem
Hi, hi, come on, let's go to Jerusalem all together
Already when I was a child, we played this game
Musical chairs, only one reaches the goal
Then when the rhythm suddenly stops
It means, it is over, there is no more free space
Hi, hi, let's go on the journey to Jerusalem
Hi, hi, come on, let's go to Jerusalem all together
We've got a dream, that never loses its power
Life is a journey, that leads to tomorrow
Peace is more than just a game, where only one can win
Because we're human
Hi, hi, let's go on the journey to Jerusalem
Hi, hi, come on, let's go to Jerusalem all together
We walk hand in hand to a peaceful land
I wish there was peace and everybody would be hand in hand
We walk hand in hand to a peaceful land
There would be friendschip and no quarels
And if we stay friends, a dream will live forever
And all this will happen in the future
Some day we'll arrive
Hi, hi, let's go on the journey to Jerusalem
Hi, hi, come on let's go to Jerusalem, all together
Hi, hi, here we go again on the journey to Jerusalem
Hi, hi, come on let's go to Jerusalem, all together
Hi, hi, hand in hand on the journey to Jerusalem
Hello, hello, we'll raise out hands with you
Peace to the world from Jerusalem"
Putnici,"Look at this star, look at these fulfilled wishes
they call this cinema of dreams, a fantasy
now when the worst has passed
why do you serve me up with that now Your years seek
something untrue and restfull
an escapement from water and current
and safety, I know it from my own experience It's like your legs are speeding
and jearning for avdenture
if you were ten years younger
but if you were still yourself Ref.
Leave me today, leave me yesterday
leave me, my fairy, whenever
leave me tomorrow or some other new morning
just don't leave me now
there's always space on the top
when you start from the bottom up Because I only have you
and I don't know how much that love is worth
I never had anyone before you
to compare you with, you know that very well Put on that wrinkle cream
maybe your smile will return
with me you are ten years younger
only with me you're yourself again Ref."
Diamond of Night,"Silently glowing, moonbeams are sowing
Silver, silver starry-eyed skies
Burning in fire, words of desire
Linger, linger, long in disguise
Diamond of night, burning so bright
Guide me my silvery new sign
Finding my way as I pray
Now I can say it is my time
Voices are calling, whilst stardust falling
Reveries, reveries lighten his heart
Silently blazing, stars so amazing
Heavenly, heavenly fire from a spark
Diamond of night, burning so bright
Guide me my silvery new sign
Finding my way as I pray
Now I can say it is my time
Diamond of night, burning so bright
Guide me my silvery new sign
Finding my way as I pray
Now I can say it is my time
Diamond of night, burning bright
Now I can say it is my time"
Sameakh (שמח),"All day long I sit in the kibbutz,
in my hand a cigar and it feels a little sour.
All the time only depression and boredom;
if I don't come, it will end with a bang. Oh... Oh... Be happy!
Oh... Oh... Be happy! Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Be happy!
Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Be happy! All day long wars on television
and in Australia there are floods again.
Here comes the Sunday depression.
I want, I want a cucumber. Oh... Oh... Be happy!
Oh... Oh... Be happy! Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Be happy!
Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Be happy! And now I have a new boyfriend from Damascus.
When I'm sad, he sends me a red rose.
It's not smart to love only when you feel like it.
I want to do it with him all day long. Oh... Oh... Be happy!
Oh... Oh... Be happy! Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Be happy!"
No Goodbyes,"Don't you know what you are doing to me?
This ain't the way to work things out
Tell me something that I've never heard before
We gotta get off this crazy roundabout

No more doubting, no more fears
No more cheating, no more tears
No more questions, no more lies
No farewells, no goodbyes
No goodbyes

I don't understand why you keep saying:
""Oh, everything's just fine, there's nothing wrong""
Something's been happening that we cannot ignore
It's time for us to sing a different song

No more doubting, no more fears
No more cheating, no more tears
No more questions, no more lies
No farewells, no goodbyes
No goodbyes

Oh, don't say anything you'll wish you hadn't said
Just say nothing at all (say nothing at all)
'Cause I know love will grow when you go
Don't say goodbye, oh no

Don't say goodbye, no goodbyes
(No goodbyes)
Don't say anything you'll wish you hadn't said, my baby
(No goodbyes)
Oh no, oh no, no

(Yeah...)
No farewells, no goodbyes"
Don't Play That Song Again,"Once I had a dream
I thought we had everything
Living such a perfect life
We had it all
And our love took flight
Deep into the night

Now I'm alone again
But I'm... I'm gonna be strong
And the tears that I have cried
You'll never see
Oh... but crying in vain was never for me

Don't play that song again
Reminding me of how it used to be
Don't play that song again
I wish it could be like before
When you were here with me, oh yeah
Oh deejay, please don't play
Don't play that song again (song again)

Time, time changes everything
And that's what they say
But it's too late for regrets
When all's said and done
It just wasn't meant to be
Now I'm the lonely one

Don't play that song again
Reminding me of how it used to be
Don't play that song again
I wish it could be like before
When you were here with me, oh yeah
Oh deejay, please don't play
Don't play that song again

Don't play that song again
Reminding me of how it used to be
Don't play that song again
I wish it could be like before
When you were here with me, oh yeah
Oh deejay, please don't play
Don't play that song again (song again)

No... oh deejay, please don't play
Don't play that song again
That song again
Don't play that song again..."
Once in a Lifetime,"I don't wish I could turn back time
I can move the mountains higher than high
Don't look back, hold on to your spirit
Keep moving every minute

I know it seems a little premature
To live for the moment, I'm just a girl
Don't look back, hold on to your spirit
Keep moving every minute

What you give is what you get
There ain't no regrets

If you give me wings and reason why
Then I'll be an angel in your sky
Because I'm seventeen only
Once in a lifetime
Read my mind

I'm ready, why are you standing still?
Are you coming with me? - I know you will
We can search the world together
Come on, baby, now or never

What you give is what you get
There ain't no regrets

If you give me wings and reason why
Then I'll be an angel in your sky
Because I'm seventeen only
Once in a lifetime
Read my mind

If you give me wings and reason why
Then I'll be an angel in your sky
Because I'm seventeen only
Once in a lifetime
Read my mind

I believe there's a better place always
Somewhere else instead
I believe the grass is greener if I chase
The magic no one else can find
(The magic no one else can find)

If you give me wings and reason why
Then I'll be an angel in your sky
Because I'm seventeen only
Once in a lifetime
Read my mind

If you give me wings and reason why
Then I'll be an angel in your sky
Because I'm seventeen only
Once in a lifetime
Read my mind

Because I'm seventeen only
Once in a lifetime"
On aura le ciel,"And in your eyes, my eyes
To dive, to cross the ocean
To finally put my hand on you
And in your arms, my arms
To fall, taken by the impulse
To finally let my fingers slide We’ll have the sky
A little bit like angels, wings
We’re flying away, you and I We’ll have the honey
A taste of orange, cinnamon
We’re flying away, you and I And on your skin, my salty skin
To savour the moments
At night, to finally laze a little bit on you, my baby And in your heart, my heart
To shine, to put down a diamond
At night, to finally think a little bit of me We’ll have the sky
A little bit like angels, wings
We’re flying away, you and I We’ll have the honey
A taste of orange, cinnamon
We’re flying away, you and I Oh, to play with clouds under the blue sky, my baby
To play with clouds under the blue sky
We’ll have the sun deeply in our eyes, my baby
We’ll have the sun deeply in our eyes And on your heart, my heart
Light, taken by the wind
Oh, you and I We’ll have the sky
A little bit like angels, wings
We’re flying away, you and I We’ll have the honey

The Moon,"I knew it all from the start
I knew you'll rise above my world
A little sun warming my heart
I betrayed myself, I knew I lied
You've searched into my soul to find love
And found me hiding deep inside
You did see a way to set me free

Now I hear when the wind is playing
With the stars of my night
Simply 'cause I have you near
Now I feel when the moon is playing
On and on and on with my heart
Simply 'cause your love is real

I knew it all, I understood
I simply blinked and let the light
Give me reasons to be good
You did see a way to set me free

Now I hear when the wind is playing
With the stars of my night
Simply 'cause I have you near
Now I feel when the moon is playing
On and on and on with my heart
Simply 'cause your love is real

Yes, I feel when the moon is playing

Now I hear how the wind is playing
With the stars of my night
Simply 'cause I have you near
Now I feel when the moon is playing
On and on and on with my heart
Simply 'cause your love is real"
Desire,"From the first day I saw you
To the last time we met
I've desired to hold you
Have you and make you mine

But to have and to hold
To love and to grow
It takes two hearts that beat
To the rhythm of one

When you push me away
I taste fear and pain
Turns my fire to smoke
With one word, with one stroke

Deep in my heart is desire to love
Deep in my soul is desire to grow
Deep in your smile is desire for more
Deep when we kiss, the feeling that can't be missed

Let me live, let me die
Let me laugh, let me cry
Let me burn in your fire
In flames of desire

Be my river of hope
My mountain of truth
Let me colour your life
With the colour of love

Deep in my heart is desire to love
Deep in my soul is desire to grow
Deep in your smile is desire for more
Deep when we kiss, the feeling that can't be missed

Take me up, take me down
Take me into your arms
Spin the magic of love
With one word, with one smile

My desire runs deep
And I'm losing sleep
I wake up to the light
You're the key to my heart

Deep in my heart is desire to love
Deep in my soul is desire to grow
Deep in your smile is desire for more
Deep when we kiss, the feeling that can't be missed

(Deep in my heart is desire to love)
Deep in my soul
(Deep in my soul is desire to grow)
Deep in your smile is desire for more
Deep when we kiss, the feeling that can't be missed

Desire, desire, desire, desire love"
My Heart Goes Boom,"Woo!

Summer, Saturday and sunshine
Suddenly, I saw you there, a stunning sight from God knows where
You were standing in the shadows
Looking quite impossible, I lost my mind and popsicle

A radio was singing
Something blue in perfect tune
Half a look over your shoulder
I couldn’t keep from staring back at you

My heart goes boom when I see you, baby
Don’t you tell me maybe, it can never be too soon
My heart goes boom, put your arms around me
Say you’re glad you found me, take me spinning round the moon
My heart goes boom

Summer, Saturday, and sunset
You said hello and I said hi, and something lit the evening sky
You came out of the shadows
With a teasing twinkle in your eye and took my senses for a ride

A radio was playing
Something slow in perfect tune
Half a smile as you sat down
I couldn’t seem to keep my eyes off you

My heart goes boom when I see you, baby
Don’t you tell me maybe, it can never be too soon
My heart goes boom, put your arms around me
Say you’re glad you found me, take me spinning round the moon
(My heart goes boom)

A radio was singing
Something blue in perfect tune
Half a look over your shoulder
I couldn’t seem to keep my eyes off you

My heart goes…
My heart goes boom when I see you, baby
Don’t you tell me maybe, it can never be too soon
My heart goes boom, put your arms around me
Say you’re glad you found me, take me spinning round the moon

My heart goes boom
Oh baby, my heart goes boom"
Solo,"Sitting alone, here in my room
Staring at your picture from midnight till noon
Counting the hours, counting the days
You know that I'll miss you in a million ways

Now I wait in the cold and this is getting old
No more stories, no more lies, take me off this ride
When you see me in the hall, I'll look at the wall
By my actions you should know - I'm going solo
Going solo

My friends try to tell me, I didn't want to listen
'Cause I'm the kind of person gotta find out on my own
I gave you my heart, you tore it apart
But I'm coming back strong, I knew it was wrong

Now I wait in the cold and this is getting old
No more stories, no more lies, take me off this ride
When you see me in the hall, I'll look at the wall
By my actions you should know

Now I wait in the cold and this is getting old
No more stories, no more lies, take me off this ride
When you see me in the hall, I'll look at the wall
By my actions you should know - I'm going solo
Going solo

Now I wait...
Wait in the cold and this is getting old
No more stories, no more lies, take me off this ride
When you see me in the hall, I'll look at the wall
By my actions you should know

Now I wait in the cold and this is getting old
No more stories, no more lies, take me off this ride
When you see me in the hall, I'll look at the wall
By my actions you should know - I'm going solo"
Envie de vivre,"The wish to live
How to live without love?
How to live without love?
How to live the wish to live?
Beyond thoughts, beyond love
We have to share far more every day
Under the wrath of time furious for 2000 years
What's left standing, it's not us
Between good and bad, lots of other feelings
Following the only star to the glory of the living God
Through the passions and distrusting all seasons
What's left standing, it's not us, but
The wish to live for eternity
The wish to live passed us by
The wish to live will remain engraved
Like in a book we have forgotten about.
But we can't survive in a world without love
The gates of life will need it every day
How could we see a smile in every look
If square one is devoid of any hope?
So I want to live, live to give
The wish to live and the wish to love
The wish to live for eternity
The wish to live passed us by
The wish to live will remain engraved
Like in a book we have discovered again
How to live without love?
How to live without love?
How to live the wish to live?"
Nomiza (Νόμιζα),"I lost everything when
I hurt and I later cried so much
Inflamed with your love
I forget your honour, I burn
But with all that touches us
So much still keeps us apart, so much
Life expects us to be different
And waits for it, but for how long?
I believed that I would find a way
To bring together all that kept us apart
You know that it’s bright red, and the fire within us
Will never die away, it’ll cause so much trouble
I’ve tried to absorb emotions for ignoring, light
I’m all right the way I am and time won’t change you
Ah… I believed that I would find a way
To bring together all that kept us apart
I believed that my heart came first
Yet I’m leaving, though I still love you (I love you)
Yeah, yeah…
I believed that I would find a way
I believed… I believed…
Nanana… nanana… nanana… ah ah ah…
I believed that my heart came first
Yet I’m leaving, though I still love you

Tell Me!,"With you in my life, it's destined to be right
And I know that it's true, girl, I was only made for you
So why don't we make the pieces fit and pack our bags tonight?
And go wherever love will take us, we'll make it all right

Tell me, tell me, tell me once, tell me twice
Tell me there is no compromise
We'll be together all the time
So say you will be mine

Ooh... with you by my side, I'm on a rollercoaster-ride
And I know that it's true - boy, I was only made for you
Listen to me now, you've got to give me a sign
'Cause I can't wait here any longer, make up your mind

Tell me, tell me, tell me once, tell me twice
Tell me there is no compromise
We'll be together all the time

Tell me, tell me, tell me once, tell me twice
Tell me there is no compromise
We'll be together all the time
So say you will be mine

If you only knew all that we could do
We'd be together all alone, you and me
Like we were always meant to be

Oh... I don't know if it's fact or fiction
But I'm sure we'll make the right decision
Look into my eyes now, baby, give it all you've got

Tell me, tell me, tell me once, tell me twice
Tell me there is no compromise
We'll be together all the time

Tell me, tell it to me once, tell me twice
Tell me there is no compromise
We'll be together all the time"
Colgado de un sueño,"Hanging from a dream
High in the sky, I try to live
The world in the distance
Seems small, seen from here
I don’t care what people say of me
That I don’t have my feet on the floor
They don’t know that I fly instead of sleeping There are no limits to my wishes here
Nothing can be forbidden
I’m sailing free through my thoughts
Don’t take me off of here There is room for my longings here
Everything can come true
Don’t make me go to the floor
I just want to remain Hanging from a dream
Floating in the air without fear to fall
The world is small
And all my anxieties don’t fit into it I don’t care what people say of me
That I don’t have my feet on the floor
Hanging from my dream, I manage to live There are no limits to my wishes here
Nothing can be forbidden
I’m sailing free through my thoughts
Don’t take me off of here There is room to my longings here
Everything can come true
Don’t make me go to the floor
I just want to remain Hanging from a dream
Hanging from a dream
Hanging from a dream"
Fly on the Wings of Love,"In the summernight, when the moon shines bright
Feeling love forever
And the heat is on, when the daylight's gone
Still happy together

There's just one more thing I'd like to add
She's the greatest love I've ever had

Fly on the wings of love
Fly baby fly
Reaching the stars above
Touching the sky

And as time goes by, there's a lot to try
And I'm feeling lucky
In the warmest sand, smiling hand in hand
Love is all around me

There's just one more thing I'd like to add
She's the greatest love I've ever had

Fly on the wings of love
Fly baby fly
Reaching the stars above
Touching the sky"

And tonight, here he is, back again! What do you have there? What do you have there?
What do you have there?
What do you have there? Does he have something there then, and if so, what is it?
Does he have something bald there, or rather some hair?
Does he have something there which no one else has?
Or does he have that on top of what he has there?
That what he has there, he just has there now
Although it was not clear at all, that that was that there
What that was, that was unclear

La vita cos'è?,"What is life?
I wake up in the morning
The coffee I made yesterday is still hot
The rain over the window
Is reading my thoughts
I wonder where my absent love is
The telephone has not rung
Your smile makes me crazy
I can't wait anymore
I know it was not easy, my fragile heart
Is burning in a moment and flies straight with the wind
I feel like a little seawave, the blueness of love
Now you are in my days
Where is life? What is life?
A thorn which hurts my heart
If you are not here
Where is life? What is life?
A balcony of love with no applause
If you are not here
Divide the world with me, make me live every day
To shine like the light of a star
To live love in the sky, is such a beautiful thing
Hold me strongly, kiss me
Where is life? What is life?
A thorn which hurts my heart
If you are not here
Where is life? What is life?
A balcony of love with no applause

A Little Bit,"I'm in love with the place where I was born
Where I lived my life in harmony with every new dawn
I'm in love with the people that I know
With whom I share my tears of laughter, the times I feel low

It's a little bit of love, it's a little love I need
To keep me going, keep me smiling
It's love that makes me breathe
It may be Finland, France or Spain
Berlin, Prague or Rome
It's the place where you live
Where your heart feels at home

There's a world that is bigger than my own
Where they strive to try and unify, to dull monotone
Every change that really matters comes from within
When in love we stand together through thick and thin

It's a little bit of love, it's a little love we need
To keep us going, keep us smiling
It's love that makes us breathe
It may be Amsterdam or Bern
Sweden or U.K.
Where your heart is at home
You will feel okay

(It's a little bit of love), it's a little love we need
To keep us going, keep us smiling
It's love that makes us breathe
It's a little bit of love, it's a little love we need
To keep us going, keep us smiling
It is love that makes us breathe

To keep us going, keep us smiling
It is love that makes us breathe"
My Star,"My friends gonna call me: hey dreamer

Tonight I know I will get there
By plane or by bus - right to my star
Pretend there are things you just don't know
In spite someone's told you are so cute
You have to ask and I will show
The snow in the summer or so, so

If my star will fall
Or disappeared at all

I will follow my star till the end of my days
And my heart's gonna lead me in so many ways
And if you gonna join me I'll be your guide
Baby, 'never say never', be my 'Runaway bride'

My friends gonna tell me: Just calm down
The clouds you are walking are so high
This is my chance, and I'll invite
All the dreamers and lovers to fly (fly)
I'm back from the future, life goes on
But still I remember my promise
You have to ask and I will show
The snow in the summer or so, so

If my star will fall
Or disappeared at all

I will follow my star till the end of my days
And my heart's gonna lead me in so many ways
And if you gonna join me I'll be your guide

Yorgunum anla,"Look, every tear is rolling down my cheek
My sheet of the past is turning yellow
The tracks are covered up, the colours are fading
Memories without love Play it for me for the last time
Take the sorrow from my heart
Take the memories without love and carry them far away
I suffer from their sadness Do you hear my aggrieved silence the moment I don't speak?
Do you still close your eyes to me? Understand that I'm weary
Do you hear my aggrieved silence the moment I don't speak?
Do you still close your eyes to me? Understand that I'm weary At last the tracks are covered
The colours are fading
Memories without love Play it for me for the last time
Take the sorrow from my heart
Take the memories without love and carry them far away
Relight my fire inside Do you hear my aggrieved silence the moment I don't speak?
Do you still close your eyes to me? Understand that I'm weary
Do you hear my aggrieved silence the moment I don't speak?
Do you still close your eyes to me? Understand that I'm weary Do you hear my aggrieved silence the moment I don't speak?
Do you still close your eyes to me?
I won't come back to you, keep me secretly in your heart
Understand me at last, I'm weary"
Millennium of Love,"Nature's child lays beside a mother's broken heart
We stand denied the power and glory
Bitterness can't feed the hungry, hate just leaves us cold
It's time to change it

I lit a candle in a dream I thought I heard
Liberated voices crying freedom
Open hearts, open doors in truth and honesty
Let wisdom be the guiding light

Celebrate the new millennium of love
Where our footprints leave a harvest for the children
Somewhere on our journey lies a world beyond compare
I believe we all have the answer

A cloud can hide a mountain
And a face can hide the pain
Search until you find the answer
There is no reason
Who can understand man's inhumanity to man?

Celebrate the new millennium of love
Where our footprints leave a harvest for the children
Somewhere on our journey lies a world beyond compare
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe in you

(Celebrate the new millennium of love)
Let our footprints leave a harvest for the children
Somewhere on our journey lies a world beyond compare
I believe we all have the answer
I believe we all have the answer"

Or the moment that my heart began to reel (Reel)
You took me in a new direction, you're showin' me a different way (Different way)
Now I'm in a situation, I will be the one to say

Why don't you take me, my baby
Hold me for all time and never leave me, believe me
Let me be your one and only

Oh yeah...

Now I know it's love, and that's a fact (That's a fact)
No return, there is no goin' back (No, no, no, no)
It might be the way you make me crazy, you always take my breath away
And now there's only one thing, baby, that there's left for me to say

Why don't you take me, my baby
Hold me for all time and never leave me, believe me
I will always be by your side
Always on my mind, my baby, take me

And everything I feel is from the bottom of my heart (Yeah...)
I'll give you everything I have, I'll give you what you never had

Why don't you take me, my baby
Hold me for all time and never leave me, believe me
I will always be by your side
Always on my mind, you take what's wrong and make it right

Take it with my body and my soul

On My Own,"In tender years the path
Seemed longer than it ever really was
How could I know
I realised as time went by I had to try
The world outside was mine
You let me go

So I left and tried to find my way to paradise
The winding road that led me there was life

I'm on my own again
Left all alone where I belong
I'm on my own again
Left all alone

Now I've seen it all
I wouldn't change a day
When curtains fall
I'd do my show

So at last I know
I've found my one true paradise
The winding road that led me there was life

I'm on my own again
Left all alone where I belong
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own
On my own

On my own
On my own, on my own
Again"
En davar (אין דבר),"if it looks like all of the way is in vain

there is a kind of song that comes to me and sings-
it's ok, it's ok, it's ok* if it hurts and both of your eyes are red
if it hurts and there is no sign of what's coming next,
i will sing to you, i will caress your head to your neck
it's ok, it's ok, it's ok. because this song comforts hearts
doesn't give up and find ways,
returns and turns bad into good
and sings again-
it's ok, it's ok ,it's ok. facing a wave of happiness- the sea of sadness is great
light and darkness are fighting over us now
only the song comes again, known and beloved-
it's ok, it's ok, it's ok. because this song comforts hearts... you will see my love, it's ok."

Eternity for us to try

The dawn will tell us if we fly

No promises, no kiss goodbye to you
Just keep on smilin', my Lady Alpine Blue

No promises, no promises
No promises, no promises

Listen to Your Heartbeat,"Authors & Composers : Thomas G:son & Henrik Sethsson
I wanna know
What you feel inside
Is something wrong
Why did you leave last night
Is it all just a game
Oh, tell me why we can't be lovers
I do believe
In the two of us
That you and me
We are the only ones
And we were meant to be true
So, tell me why we can't be lovers
How could I be such a fool
I thought I already knew it all, but I know
I was totally wrong

CHORUS :
Listen to your hearbeat
It will take you higher
Follow your emotions
I know you'll get stronger
Listen to your heartbeat
Your feeling will guide you
Hold on to devotion
I know it's inside you
How will I know
If you're fooling me
Maybe I'm wrong
But it seems, to be like
It's all just a game
And I just want us to be lovers
We had it all in our hands
Just like those all happy ends
I still don't know why
But we lost it somehow

One more chance to make a try
Nothing left to do for you and I

Too Much,"The day before marriage, I
Was out so long in the night
My lovely fiancé
No more was filling my sight
Why do I feel this way?
Dunno, last night was great
But something screwed me up

Went in the streets with my bride
She wanted coffee
Oh no, I'm voting for beer
You see how good is she

And let the fiddler play on the strings of my heart
And let the fiddler play on the strings of my heart

Don't break my heart tonight, don't leave me when I cry
Stay now and softly play the strings of my heart
I want you by my side, you make me feel all right
And let the fiddler play on the strings of my heart

Don't break my heart, oh no
(Don't break my heart, don't break my heart, don't break my heart)
I want you by my side, you make me feel all right

Só sei ser feliz assim,"Only can be happy this way
Yeah... whoa yeah...
I still remember, but right now I don't know
If it was to you that I told my secret
I walk without direction, I search for your sea
It's your island that I want to find
It's in your kiss that I find the charm
In your hug I find the heat that I need
In your glance, an insolent desire
With your love, everything makes sense
Oh, I only can be happy this way
Like your kiss holding onto me
Oh, I only can be happy this way
Mad, insane about you till the end
Beyond the reason, the magic is born
Cristals of illusion, you are my fantasy
It's in your kiss that I find the charm
In your hug I find the heat that I need
In your glance, an insolent desire
With your love, everything makes sense
Oh, I only can be happy this way
Like your kiss holding onto me
Oh, I only can be happy this way
Mad, insane about you till the end
Oh, I only can be happy this way

Without Your Love,"I don't want to live my life without you
And I don't ever want to say goodbye
You're the only one that I am here for
Never want to see you cry
And I can't go on, oh no
No, I can't go on, oh no
Without your love
Without your heart
I'd be lost here in the dark
I just don't know
Where would I be
Without your love
You're the light in the dark
I want to wake up with you beside me
I will never let this feeling die
I just want to be here in the morning
See the sunlight in your eyes
But I can't go on, oh no
No, I can't go on, oh no
Without your love
Without your heart
I'd be lost here in the dark
I just don't know
Where would I be
Without your love
Without your love
Without your heart
I'd be lost here in the dark
I just don't know
Where would I be
Without your love
'Cause you're the light in the dark"
Dile que la quiero,"If you happen to see her, ask her
What she is feeling
Ask her if she still has some of that love
That brought us together left If you notice that
She seems indifferent
Knock some reason into her
And do me a favour (Chorus)
Talk to her and keep telling her
That some one tried to hurt us
That everything is a lie
Tell her that I love her
That I was always sincere
Tell her that I'm going crazy
Because of this nonsense
Tell her that I'm sailing
Through love and fear
Tell her that this melancholy
Is killing me Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I'm sincere
Tell her that this melancholy
Is killing me If you happen to see her, please remind her
That the doors of my heart
Are wide open
For her Tell her that my tears
Don't understand
The reason why she's not with me
In this room (Chorus) Tell her, tell her, tell her
Tell her that I'm going crazy Tell her, tell her, tell her
Tell her that I love her
That I was always sincere
Tell her that I'm going crazy
Because of this nonsense
Tell her that I'm sailing
Through love and fear
Tell her that this melancholy
Is killing me Tell her..."
Je n'ai que mon âme,"Since we must say, since we must talk about ourselves
Since your heart doesn't burn like it did before anymore
Even though love, I think, can't be said
But since we must talk, listen to me But all I have is my soul
To tell you about myself
Oh, only my soul
My soul and my voice
Flames so fragile
On my fingertips
Ridiculous weapons
To tell you about myself Even though you say I'm a part of you
That our story will follow us step by step
I know very well that love has its own laws
If we must save it, listen to me But all I have is my soul
To tell you about myself
Oh, only my soul
My soul and my voice
And my body which goes up in flames
Upon hearing your voice
I am only a woman
Who silently loves you But let God damn me
If I forget my way
Let life condemn you
If you're not my law anymore
And if this flame which burns for you
Goes out
All I have is my soul
To tell you about myself
All I have is my soul
To tell you about myself"
Sevgiliye son,"The end of love
In my every song, every word, in any night of mine without you
You were there, you again, my heart trembles because you're not here
On the long endless roads, in the rain, in my tears
You were there, you again, my heart trembles because you're not here
For the last time look behind
What's left except your sorrow
Please look behind to see what you've left
While my arms are waiting for you, my love is on the roads
It is going mad
Ah, this heart of mine beats always with the pain you brought to me
The one that carries you in it like crazy
So far away, so far apart, lonely am I, my love, tonight
Longing for all I left behind, precious moments I no longer find
Love has gone, memories - they fade away
Nothing more left for me but only to say
I still love you, please come back, my lonely heart
Keeps calling you back, once again
I feel that old pain, lonely am I now, tonight
Oh..."

Electric runs right through me, I'm in ecstasy
Your caress, the sweetness on your lips
But the closer that I get, you're drifting away

With every heartbeat, I'm electrified
With just one look your body moves me, moves me
If for one second you'd remember me
Then I would break free
From these chains that are wrapped around me

Wer Liebe lebt,"Summer sunshine
that falls in your room
bright and warm
hugs you
and the shadowy look
that troubles your days
will once again clear up
From ice comes fire
when her magic gently touches you And your gray day
Shines with the suddenness/suddenly shines
and you hear the melody
full of feeling and full of poetry (One) who lives love
becomes immortal
(One) who lives love
is never alone
Seek it on each new day (At) times it smiles at you
and will stand close to you for life (At) times complete happiness lies
in a moment
and you seek the melody
full of feeling and full of poetry Hand in hand with you
I want to live love
And with you fly towards
the dream
You are everything,
the laughter and the tears
Only with you do I want to
feel the love"

Another Summer Night,"The golden sand, beneath my feet
There's music in the air
A guitar in my hand, I'm sure you'll understand
All this is magic
No matter where the wind blows
I'll always think of you
Stay with me, young and free
We'll live in perfect harmony
Another summer night, here by the ocean
Under the palm trees you and I
Walking on the beach beneath the moonlight
Just like a dream that never dies, never dies, never dies
Blue skies all around me, feels like love is everywhere
Just a smile, and our eyes
Will meet so we can feel the fire burning
A taste of heaven is all I need, I never get enough
Million stars, endless sky
With this moment passing by
Another summer night, down by the ocean
Under the palm trees you and I
Walking on the beach beneath the moonlight
Just like a dream that never dies, never dies, never dies
Another summer night, down by the ocean
Under the palm trees you and I
Walking on the beach beneath the moonlight
Just like a dream that never dies, never dies, never dies"

Never Ever Let You Go,"Each morning I wake up alone
For too long I've been on my own
You seem to fill my heart and mind
The greatest love that I could find
Love that I could find

I'll never ever let you go
Though you hurt my feelings
You bring back memories all the time
I'll never ever be the same
Since you left me lonely
So please come back to me again

These last days I've been down and blue
I wonder if you miss me too
I think about you all the time
And keep on waiting for a sign
Waiting for a sign

I'll never ever let you go
Though you hurt my feelings
You bring back memories all the time
I'll never ever be the same
Since you left me lonely
So please come back to me again

I cry out your name
I'm sick and tired of this game
Oh baby, kiss me
I think this love was meant to be
Love was meant to be

I'll never ever let you go
Though you hurt my feelings
You bring back memories all the time
I'll never ever be the same
Since you left me lonely
So please come back to me again

I'll never ever let you go

Northern Girl,"In all my wanderings around the world
I met so many kinds of pretty girls
All of them like precious stones
Sparkling on their own

I found them fiery, tender, bright and sweet
In Rome and Paris, Lisbon and Madrid
But one girl remains for me
Still a real mystery
I've been thinkin' about you

Northern girl, Lady Ice - how can I melt you, baby?
Northern girl, never cries - tough like a pearl
Northern girl, frosty eyes, I wanna melt you, baby
Northern girl

We drink the sunset like ruby wine
But still you keep your head and hold the line
Even when you look aside
I admire your pride

We stand together closely, skin to skin
You look forbidding as the Snow Queen
But I hear your secret call
'Cause your fortress has no walls
I'm still thinkin' about you

Northern girl, Lady Ice - how can I melt you, baby?
Northern girl, never cries - tough like a pearl
Northern girl, frosty eyes, I wanna melt you, baby
Northern girl

Northern girl, Lady Ice - how can I melt you, baby?
Northern girl, never cries - tough like a pearl
Northern girl, frosty eyes, I wanna melt you, baby
Northern girl

And when you ask me tonight
Why I search for love so, so far
I will hold you and whisper
You're my Northern Star, guiding star, baby

Northern girl, Lady Ice - how can I melt you, baby?
Northern girl, never cries - tough like a pearl
Northern girl, frosty eyes, I wanna melt you, baby
Northern girl

Northern girl, Lady Ice - how can I melt you, baby? (You're my northern girl)

Runaway,"Did somebody dare to tell what's right
Which colours to wear to laugh or cry
You want to be fair and maybe you're right
Lets burn our fingers stop the fight

Always driving through the red lights babe
Everybody stops but me

Just run away to the stars
Just run away 'til you're high enough
I will be waiting above
And make that happen I tried so hard

How lucky you are your statement in fine
Because what you think is what you find

Always driving through the red lights babe
Everybody stops but me

Just run away to the stars
Just run away 'til you're high enough
I will be waiting above
And make that happen I tried so hard

Just run away to the stars
Just run away 'til you're high enough
I will be waiting above
And make that happen I tried so hard

Did somebody say it's gonna be easy
Til you get to where you do belong
Your newly opened mind explains the reasons
Why you have to carry on

Just run away to the stars
Just run away 'til you're high enough
I will be waiting above
And make that happen I tried so hard

Just run away to the stars
Just run away 'til you're high enough
I will be waiting above

Od nas zavisi (Од нас зависи),"The wind brings me
Memories from a time
That seems so far away
But now that's changed
Everything lost its glow The falling snow
Warms me with old love
Which gives me desire for life
But the wheel will turn again, you know Come on, try to imagine
Just for a moment, one place
А piece of land at south
It can be paradise for you
You know, that depends on us Now, we all are here
At the same place, at this time
Which seems so unclear
But the wheel will turn, you know
Right? Imagine it
Just for a moment, one place
А piece of land at south
It can be paradise for you
You know, that depends on us Come on, try to imagine
Just for a moment, one place
А piece of land at south
It can be paradise for you
You know, that depends on us"
Light a Candle (Nadlik beyakhad ner) (נדליק ביחד נר),"At times it seems like there's no hope,
And everything looks so gloomy and uncertain.
The flowers in the garden and in fields have not bloomed yet,
And only wind is blowing at night.
Then lets together light a candle, a candle. Light a candle
Light a candle with me
A thousand candles in the dark
Will open our hearts At times it seems that tomorrow
Will  bring no consolation to stop you crying and being upset,
And long night drags on without confidence,
And the darkness is sharp as a razor.
Then lets together light a candle, a candle Light a candle
Light a candle with me
A thousand candles in the dark
Will open our hearts Light all the candles
Let's light the candles everywhere
Just look at me and take my hand
The heat of love will glow again"
Dans le jardin de mon âme,"In the garden of my soul
I dream of a summer house
That only belongs to us
Of an island on which
The dream goes on until the end
Of a small Garden of Eden
Cradle of our love
That realizes this dream
By offering its treasures
In the garden of my soul
Your heart is covered in flowers
In the garden of my soul
You will find your home
The most beautiful rose
Delighted me a thousand times
In the garden of my soul
There's only you for me
Come into my summer house
Come and find me
Love lends you its wings
You will arrive there
The fortune that finds us
Followed us from afar
Nothing can separate us
We are its witnesses
In the garden of my soul
Your heart is covered in flowers
In the garden of my soul
You will find your home
The most beautiful rose
Delighted me a thousand times
In the garden of my soul
There's only you for me
In the garden of my soul
Your heart is covered in flowers
In the garden of my soul
You will find your home
The most beautiful rose
Delighted me a thousand times
In the garden of my soul
There's only you for me"
Never Let It Go,"(Don't ever stop)
All right, girls
(Are you shaking?)

Surrounded by sharp-looking eyes
Dancing in a fever
Forgetting all the words of advice
Moving in and closer

What a life we have
What a life we live
And it's smiling right at us
What a life we share
Gonna get it there

So, never let it go
Never stop till you know
We'll be reaching for the top tonight
Surrender to the beat up and down
In the heat we'll be shaking, shaking

So, never let it go
Never stop till you know
We'll be reaching for the top tonight
And when the night is over
I'll take you in my arms now

Blinded by the scent of your love
Sailing on this feeling
And my mind is high up above
I don't know if I'm dreaming

What a life we have
What a life we live
And it's smiling right at us
What a life we share
Gonna get it there

So, never let it go
Never stop till you know
We'll be reaching for the top tonight
Surrender to the beat up and down
In the heat we'll be shaking, shaking
(We'll be shaking)

So, never let it go

And when the night is over
What a life we share
Gonna get it there
I'll take you in my arms

Addicted to You,"You don't know how I was then
All broken up, my pride was stolen
I lived a little lie, I wouldn't show the hurting inside

I was livin' in emptiness, I was out of love
Guard my heart, my wall was so high
You came in with all your confidence
You swept me away off the ground, you taught me to fly

Holding on until the next time, I can't get you out of my mind
If you were a drug, I'd be addicted to you
Every time that we say 'goodbye', I just die a little inside
How'd I fall so hard? - I'm so addicted to you

Addicted to you, addicted to you
So addicted to you, I'm so addicted to you, oh...

Why couldn't this be simple?
We'd live just like the other people
Now that you're far away, my missing is a constant heartache

'Cause those sparkles back in my eyes
I wish I could stay just like this, don't want you to go
When you're far away, fantasize
That you're in my arms and I jump when I hear the phone

Holding on until the next time, I can't get you out of my mind
If you were a drug, I'd be addicted to you
Every time that we say 'goodbye', I just die a little inside
How'd I fall so hard? - I'm so addicted to you

Addiction - it's hitting hard
Now it's got its hold
Oh... I can't let go

(Holding on until the next time,) I can't get you out of my mind
If you were a drug, I'd be addicted to you
Every time that we say 'goodbye', I just die a little inside
How'd I fall so hard? - I'm so addicted to you

Holding on until the next time, I can't get you out of my mind
If you were a drug, I'd be addicted to you"
Tell Me Who You Are,"Morning light breaking darkness
Bringing dawn on again
I can feel you are restless
I'm afraid for day to begin

You are here, still around me
But your mind goes runnin' free

Tell me who you are, show me what to do
Let me be the one that you hold on to
Open up your heart, let me look inside
Baby, we'll go wrong if you try to hide
So tell me who you are

Not a word, not a whisper
I'm confused, feelin' low
In my dreams sweet surrender
Through your arms like a river I flow

You are here, still around me
But your mind goes runnin' free

Tell me who you are, show me what to do
Let me be the one that you hold on to
Open up your heart, let me look inside
Baby, we'll go wrong if you try to hide
So tell me who you... tell me who you are

You are here, still around me
But your mind goes runnin' free, oh...

(Tell me who you are, show me what to do)
Tell me who you are
(Let me be the one that you hold on to)
Let me be the one you hold on to

(Open up your heart, let me look inside)
Open up your heart and let me look inside
(Baby, we'll go wrong if you try to hide)
Baby, we'll go wrong if you hide

Tell me who you are, show me what to do
Let me be the one that you hold on to
Open up your heart, let me look inside
Baby, we'll go wrong if you try to hide
So tell me who you are"

You I don’t want, I only sin with you
Comforting words are not necessary
I don’t love you any more, move away from me, no, no

(Yeah, yeah)
I have that thing called the heart
Because of you, it’s now looking for tears
On a pillow for two made of illusions
The thoughts are far, miles away
Love is on a journey to shatter someone else’s dreams
On a pillow for two, I’m alone now
Steps are moving far, miles away
Love is on a journey to shatter someone else’s dream

No, I will never, I will never want him (Yeah, yeah)

Sister,"Sister, Sister, Sister, Sister

Once upon a time
I was looking for a girl like you
Like the thunder in the night
Though the fire's burning so brand new
She was getting so much younger
And she never learnt what to do
That's why I'm telling you

Sister come on and move your body
Sister so come on and make my day
I'm in love and I can make you feel this way
That's what I wanna say

Oh yeah, that's what I wanna say, honey
Come on

When a boy becomes a man
Guess you better know the chance you take
Don't you play your game so fast
Cause a broken heart's the price you pay
So let me try and make it better
Cause there's so much more that we can do
That's why I'm telling you

Sister come on and move your body
Sister so come on and make my day
I'm in love and I can make you feel this way
That's what I wanna say
Oh baby

Sister get it right the first time
Sister don't you wait another day
I'm in love and I can make you feel this way
That's what I wanna say

(Sister) Let's make it better
(Make my day) I just can't wait
(Sister) It's now or never
(Make my day) Don't you walk away
(Sister) Let's stick together
(Maky my day) Night and day
Baby, won't you show me the way

Il faut du temps (Je me battrai pour ça),"It takes some time
To learn how to smile
To learn how to grow
In the midst of a battle It takes some time
To learn how to love
To share one's toys
But we have yet to come this far It takes some time
That's what they tell us, they tell us!
We talk and we write
And the war keeps attracting people It takes some time
But those who can't hear keep talking
When the dust settles
And I pray to the wind I used to fight for that
I used to clutch in my voice
All those words that scare us
When we don't hear them I used to fight for that
I used to clutch in my voice
All those women who cry
And that we can't see It takes some time
To take lightly
All those hasty ideals
That make blood splatter It takes some time
No! We must want to be strong!
Mister Gandhi is dead
Will he be dead for a long time? I will fight for that
Here and now
I've no longer got the time
There only one life ahead of me I will fight for that
I will fight so hard
Peace ist nothing but a child
That has gone astray I'm only a small soldier
With no weapon but my voice
But I will cry for you
For you, my dove I'm only a small soldier
Now and there
But thousands of voices
Will shout it out with me I will fight for that
Here and now
I hear the wind rise
But who will stand up? I will fight for that
I will fight so hard
They say that it takes some time
But thousands of voices... will shout it out with me"
I Can't Live Without Music,"You're my song in the morning
You're the rhythm of my heartbeat at night
And the sound of love I hear in your voice
Keeps on touching me deep inside

You are the air that I breathe
And the gentle tune of whisperin' trees
You're the only melody that's in my soul
And in my mind all the time

I can't live without music
Only you keep me goin' along
I can't live without music
And the power that's deep in your song

You're the one and only thing I couldn't do without
Makes me wanna sing and dance and shout

We can't live without music
We can't live without music
It's a rainbow in the night
Turns darkness into light
It's everything we really need

We can't live without music
And if ever we lose it
That's when everybody, just everybody
Starts getting the blues (We can't live without music)
'Cause it's freedom to me and to you

So let the music touch your heart
In times when men are worlds apart
'Cause only love can heal the dream
That's hidden in our souls

And hand in hand we'll walk along
We'll be united by a peaceful song
And we'll live all together

(We can't live, live without)
(We can't live, live without)
(We can't live without music)

I can't live without music (We can't live without music)
I can't live without music (We can't live without music)
And if anybody, just anybody, is asking me why

Music makes me feel like flyin'
Gives me hope when I'm a-cryin'
I believe without it I would die"
Leylaklar soldu kalbinde,"Stay, don’t go now, stay with me tonight
You’ve been hurt, I know, please let it stay in the past
My eyes are longing for you
I’m sad, silent and still
I’m worn out without you
Stay, don’t leave now, I’m lonely inside
I know your heart is broken, lilacs faded in your heart
I walk on the beach, empty without you
I’m sad, silent and still
I’m worn out without you
With happiness in your hands (Na nana nana nana…)
Why are you going away?
Please don’t go, may this yearning cease
Let us live our love
Stay, oh, stay, my love, I only ask one more night
Please don’t go, I know you’re hurt, lilacs have faded in your heart
Remember those days of love, but now no more
When you’re gone I’m so blue
It’s so sad and lonely without you
Don’t ever let love pass you by (Na nana nana nana…)
Not hard if you will try
Take it now, hold it while you can
You’ll be lost when love comes to an end
With happiness in your hands (Na nana nana nana…)
Why are you going away?
Please don’t go, may this yearning cease
Let us live our love

7th Wonder,"Seven degrees'
I'm down on my knees
Waiting for the man to put me under his spell
7:05'
He walks in to sight
Giving me the eye he lifts my spirits high
His passion burns, and my luck takes a turn
I'm reborn and alive with his love to survive

Is it good? Is it bad?
Am I simply going mad?
Is it fiction? Or fact?
Am I really losing tact?
Is he magical?
Logical?
Natural wonder'
He's got the makings of my 7th wonder

Seventy-three'
Kisses for me
That whisper through the silence his feelings for me
Softly he dips'
My cherry-red lips
In the essence of hope on which my love can float
His passion burns, and my luck takes a turn

Is it good? Is it bad?
Am I simply going mad?
Is it fiction? Or fact?

Is he magical?
Logical?
Natural'I wonder'

Tell Me Why,"We are behaving like two strangers in the gloomy night
We have lost so many feelings in this endless fight
If you want to go away, now I must obey
But for my part, you'll remain always in my heart

Tell me why we have to say goodbye
Was our love only a foolish lie?
Tell me why your eyes are cold and dry
No more tears, no more fears
Nothing more to share together

If you want to go away, now I must obey
But for my part, you'll remain always in my heart

Tell me why we have to say goodbye
Why we broke our wings in flight
Tell me why couldn't we just try
To forgive and believe we can reach the sky

Tell me why we have to say goodbye
Was our love only a foolish lie?
Tell me why your eyes are cold and dry
No more tears, no more fears
Nothing more to share together

Tell me why"
Samo ljubezen,"A heart as big as the world
A smile and sparkles in the eyes
And a word, the one you know too
There are many paths in life
Don't look for happiness where there's none
Just listen to what your heart is telling you I can only gift you my love
One and only hope
Look me in the eyes, you don't have to worry
I know that you feel the same What you wish for, it isn't a sin
That's love, in your eyes You know me better than you think
Even though you shut your eyes to it
When you look at me, you see what you are You've been searching for a long time
For what you've thought was right
But in the end you'll only pick one thing I can only gift you my love
One and only hope
Look me in the eyes, you don't have to worry
I know that you feel the same Whoa... I can only gift you my love
One and only hope
Look me in the eyes, you don't have to worry
(Look me in the eyes, you don't have to worry) Because you feel it in your heart
Oh... because you feel it in your heart"
I Wanna,"I'd like to go away, but it's easier to stay
That you know all the tricks that make that make stay
I`m ready to support this art-full game you always play
'Cause you don`t know the fee which you will later, later pay

Today you think you are the winner
Today you think you are the king
You make me sweat in my emotions
Under your fly-away, fly-away wing

I wanna be the sun-shine in your arms
I wanna be the light from shooting stars
I wanna be the Queen in your sweet lies
I wanna be the love-spark in your eyes

I like a simple game, but it`s just easier to say
That you own all that rules your crazy, crazy way
And even through you`ll go like to do what ever what ever you may
Just remember it`s me who finds you when, when you was stray

Today you think you are the winner
Today you think you are the king
You make me sweat in my emotions
Under your fly-away, fly-away wing

I wanna be the sun-shine in your arms
I wanna be the light from shooting stars
I wanna be the Queen in your sweet lies
I wanna be the love-spark in your eyes"
Happy You,"(I) Wanna show to you alone
The world around us high and low
Glowing stars and dancing moon
Happy I 'cause happy you

Close your eyes and make a wish
Could it be a scorching kiss?
You're my sweetest mountain dew
Happy I 'cause happy you

For our dreams come true
They always do

Watching the sunrise, beautiful red skies
Hoping this day will never end
Singing a love song with a perfect rhyme
A song of love composed for you

Love brings passion, love brings joy
Love brings riches we enjoy
All is wonder, all is new
Happy I 'cause happy you

For our dreams come true...

Watching the sunrise
Babe, it looks great!
Singing a love song
Babe, it sounds great!"

Weil der Mensch zählt,"The animals on earth, I like them rather much,
but the ones I like best, are the hares and the bears. Soonly all birds will die, soonly all the beetles will die.
Only Adam lies in the bed and multiplies with Eve. The hares live in the forest,
the cats in the meadows,
and the cockroaches,
they live behind the tiles Little hares have got short noses,
and little kitties have soft paws,
And Mrs. Holle likes the wool,
of dromedaries from Africa. The difference between humans, between apes and primats,
is not much bigger than with noodles and pancakes. But who wants to learn more about animals, has to study biology,
or get information from my homepage afterwards. Some animals, they have wings,
and others have fins,
some live in freedom
and the others are canned. Little hares have got short noses,
and little kitties have soft paws,
And Mrs. Holle likes the wool,
of dromedaries from Africa. Little hares have got short noses,
and little kitties have soft paws,
And Mrs. Holle likes the wool,
of dromedaries from Africa."
We've Got the World,"She stands under moonlight
She touches her hair
Her smile adds emotions
And her love fills the air

And I know you're my every tomorrow
And I know that you'll always be there

We've got the world tonight
Lets hold on together
And we've got a love that's right
So open your heart
'Cos we've got tonight

We move even closer
With hope in our eyes
'Cos love is the answer
To the hurt and the lies

And I know you're my every tomorrow
And I know that you'll always be there

We've got the world tonight
Lets hold on together
And we've got a love thats right
So open your heart
We've got the world tonight
Lets hold on together
And we've got a love thats right
So open your heart

Ask me why, the sun and the moon go round
Ask me why, my feet never touch the ground
Tell the truth and take my breath away

We've got the world tonight
We've got the world tonight
Lets hold on together
And we've got a love thats right
So open your heart
Cos we've got the world tonight
Lets hold on together
And we've got a love thats right
So open your heart
Cos we've got tonight"
Everyway That I Can,"[Verse 1]
I feel you moving on a different course
Making a way for a distant cause
You say you love me and you roll your eyes
Turn to stare at the empty skies
I thought it was over and we passed all that
All we've done is to pass back to frame number one
Come on, now, now
I want to show you all again what it would be like
If you just let go and let me love you

[Chorus]
Every way that I can
I'll try to make you love me again
Every way that I can
I'll give you all my love and then
Every way that I can
I'll cry, I'll try
Make you mine again

[Verse 2]
Hold me closer, oh, so good
You make me feel just like I should
I know what you're thinking: uhuh good
Now the rest of the world is overruled
Tell me what you see in other girls all around
Come on closer and tell me what you don't find here
Come on, now, now
I want to be the everything you've been missing out
Just let go and let me love you

[Chorus]
Every way that I can
I'll try to make you love me again
Every way that I can
I'll give you all my love and then
Every way that I can
I'll cry, I'll try
Make you mine again

I'm in love with you
I'll do all you want me to
You make me want to huhuh
Make me want to huhuhuh
I'm in love with you
I'll do all you want me to
You make me want to huhuh
Make me want to huhuhuh

[Interlude]
Nothing in the world that could stop me, no sir
Nothing in the world that could stop me, no sir
Nothing in the world that could stop me, no sir
Nothing in the world that could stop me, no sir
No, no, no, no, no

Every way that I can
I'll try to make you love me again
Every way that I can
I'll give you all my love and then
Every way that I can
I'll cry, I'll try
Make you mine again"
To Dream Again,"When you lay your eyes on me
The feeling sets me free

You're my vision of love
The very heart of life
The last word

'Cause you made me dream again
You took me where I've never been
You made me dream again

Don't let me fall apart
Please, don't break my heart
I love you

Your kisses I would miss
Your smile and your caress
I love you

The winter's gone
When the summer comes around
Like the love I found

Now I'm helpless as you
Just drift away from me
And I miss you

And you made me dream again
You took me where I've never been
You made me dream again

Don't let me fall apart
Please, don't break my heart
I love you

Your kisses I would miss
Your smile and your caress
I love you

The winter's gone
When the summer comes around
Like the love I found

Don't let me fall apart
Please, don't break my heart
I love you

Your kisses I would miss
Your smile and your caress
I love you

Don't let me fall apart
Please, don't break my heart
I love you

Your kisses I would miss
Your smile and your caress
I love you

Deixa-me sonhar (Só mais uma vez),"Take the sun, take the sea
Take with you the light of my moonlight
Take the dawning, from the sky take the colour
Leave the nightfall and my pain, and my pain
But when you go
Let me dream only one more time
And think you’re going to stay always beside me
Make me believe only one more time
That I’m still everything to you Take the air that I breathe
Leave my life without sense
Take my smile, my heart
Take my destiny in your hand, in your hand And when you go
Let me dream only one more time
And think you’re going to stay always beside me
Make me believe only one more time
That I’m still everything to you And if time doesn’t pass

To tell me
When to go straight
When to turn And who do you think you are

You've lost me years ago
Years ago (Chorus)
I'm no longer yours
I'm not the one who suffers
Just to be loved by someone I'll always be myself
Whether I'm good or bad
But I'll always be sure
Sure of myself I don't need anyone
To show me
What to do
What I'm allowed to do
And what I'm not And who do you think you are
trying to judge me
You're wasting your time
Everything's over now
It's too late for you to learn

Last night in the discotheque
All my friends seemed to look and wait
Just lookin' for trouble
'Cause everything's drivin' 'em mad
(Yeah, drivin' 'em mad)

No fun, not a smilin' face
And down at heart in so many ways

Hits you on a brand new day

See the girl with the high heel shoes
I wanna know why she's got the blues
Don't ya stop a-rockin'
And get the ball a-rollin' tonight
(Yeah, get the ball a-rollin' tonight)

Everyone's kinda cool and stressed
Gotta move, or you'll miss the best
Whatever you do now
You just gotta do it right

Dime,"A calm sea in the afternoon
 And everything will be as it was before
 I play with the sand between my feet
 Unresistingly I draw your name How many times did I call you in the night?
 How many times did I look for you?
 I return for my memories
 And I don’t lose faith Tell me what it is that I can do
 How I can keep you in my life
 Let’s forget yesterday
 And start again, without lies Tell me what it is that I can do
 How I can keep you in my life Someone told me that you’re the same
 And that you felt bad, like me
 Don’t let it be pride
 That decides for us two Because you know that I love you
 And everything that I told you isn’t true
 Leave your fears, we can
 If you want to try again Tell me what it is that I can do
 How I can keep you in my life
 Let’s forget yesterday
 And start again, without lies Tell me what it is that I can do
 How I can keep you in my life You and I know
 That we can’t live like this
 Come back to me Tell me what it is that I can do
 How I can keep you in my life
 Let’s forget yesterday
 And start again, without lies Tell me what it is that I can do
 How I can keep you in my life Tell me, tell it to me"
Words for Love (Milim la'ahava) (מילים לאהבה),"There are million words for love
I only don't find yet words that lead to you

I will find the word that leads to you, to the love It's my way to say I want you
S'agapo, je t'aime, I love you
Te amo, or just ""I love you"" It's my way to say I want you
S'agapo, je t'aime, I love you
Te amo, and I love you - I love I love you, yeah I am a romantican
I go begging just like in the movies of Valentino
Asking to find the word
That erases all the question marks I will learn languages

Cry Baby,"Love, love’s not enough
I need your trust
But you don’t try anymore

Hon, you still turn me on
Though your love has gone
And I don’t wanna cry anymore
I thought our love would last forever

Bye bye, baby
Lied to me, baby
Must have been crazy

Hasta la vista,"Don't try to deny

Never Let You Go,"I don't know what I'm going through
Close my eyes still see you in sight
Everything reminds of you
I could never let you go

I can't hide my feelings at all
I give you love sometimes it's so hard
Without you I know I would fall
'Cause I'd never let you go

I would cry for you
And I'd lie for you
I would lay my life on the line
I can't hide from you
That I'd die for you
But I'd never let you go

What we share keeps me alive
For you there's nothing I would deny
All I know is I want you so
'Cause I'd never let you go

I would cry for you
And I'd lie for you
I would lay my life on the line
I can't hide from you
I'd reach the sky for you
But I'd never let you go"
I'm Not Afraid to Move On,"One moment at a time
Someone finds the secret waiting behind
Knowing there's an end to a glory
End to a story so good, so divine
Heart, listen to your beating
Never gonna stop unless there's a doubt
Never speak to someone that knows you
More than yourself and the ghost that you'll hide
Cos I'm in love with a beautiful girl
She's the one from the magical world
And I hold her now when the rain starts to fall
I'm not afraid to move on
Lay down with someone strange
Dare to be the same as always in time
Slowly seek the end and its glory
Worry to see if it's gone deep inside
Cos I'm in love with a beautiful girl
She's the one from the magical world
And I hold her now when the rain starts to fall
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to move on
I'm alone when the ghost starts to haunt
I'm alone but I know
I'm in love with a beautiful girl
She's the one from the magical world
And I hold her now when the rain starts to fall
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to move on"

Nothing has been like before since we lost each other
The rivers, the ocean, all the seas have perished
And the Earth, the Earth is no longer turning for me
I'm questioning heaven like a crestfallen angel Oh, my love
Where are you, my love? I used to know joy and then pain
I was with you, I've got nowhere to stay
I know that I should no longer talk about it
And at least try to forget a little We promised each other heaven on Earth
Not a single rainy day, just sunshine
I know that I should no longer talk about it
Und I haven't stopped loving you Yes, I used to know my heart, I know it's lying in ambush
A memory, even an illusion, and my blood rushes back
And the Earth, the Earth is no longer turning for me
I'm naked and without wings like a fallen angel Oh, my love
Where are you, my love?
Oh, my love
Where are you, my love? Lala lalala… lala lalala…
Lala lalala… nana nanana… I used to know joy and then pain
I was with you, I've got nowhere to stay
I know that I should no longer talk about it
And at least try to forget a little We promised each other heaven on Earth
Not a single rainy day, just sunshine
I know that I should no longer talk about it
Und I haven't stopped loving you Heaven on Earth
Just sunshine
No longer talking about it
Forgetting a little Heaven on Earth
Just sunshine
No longer talking about it
And I haven't stopped loving you"
Keine Grenzen – Żadnych granic,"I wish I were an astronaut
 Who looks down to the earth from up there
 Because all those, who already were up there
 They all say it’s wonderful Here you’ll feel time slower passing by
 Silence and peace that we miss so much
 And here today it could also be this way
 We’re small, but not necessarily bad No borders, no flags
 From up there, the world is just beautiful
 No countries, no nations
 No wars can be seen from up there Everyone should go there at least once
 To realise this struggle doesn’t make sense
 Perhaps it will take our stupid megalomania
 And instead of talking, we begin to love No borders, no flags
 No stupid quarrels, no different races
 No wars, no states
 No wars can be seen from up there Unlimited (Unlimited)
 Peace without flags (Peace without flags)
 From the height, borders can’t be seen anymore
Unlimited (Unlimited), unusually
 Without quarrels, explosions, rage and wars
 From up there the world is just beautiful"
Hello from Mars,"Time would have passed me by if I
Had never asked you why
Your eyes were open wide
That day you saw me cry

I'm not that kind of girl
Who only dreams of pearls
Just give me wings of love
And make it real

Cause I'm not afraid
Of a blade
That we need to cross today
But I'm scared
To be shared
By someone else

Cause this is gonna be
The day that we will meet
When heaven comes so down to Earth
To say hello from Mars

My emotions take me high
They seem to reach the sky
I still believe we try
To hit the ground or fly

Life is a mystery
Like a perfect harmony
No one knows that day when love
Will come and set you free"

Eighties Coming Back,"You thought you had it coming
But now you really, really just don't know
It seems you make a deal far too big outta this

Aha, you thought that you'd done it
Yeah, you thought that you had heard it all
But the state of things is putting you down now
Just because, whoa...

You know they say it's just the eighties coming back
Can you feel it's the eighties coming back?
Yeah, I know it's just the eighties coming
Eighties coming, eighties coming
Eighties coming back

You said let's do it
Let's take it out and dance all night
But those deep synthesizer sounds freak you out
Whoa...

And now you wake up in the middle of the night
In terror, all you do is cry
Cold sweat, a cup of tea, no nothing seems to help you
Through the night, my God

Now, it feels just like the eighties coming back
Can you feel it's the eighties coming back?
Yeah, I know it's just the eighties coming
Eighties coming, eighties coming
Eighties coming back

Yeah, you thought you had it coming
But now it looks like you didn't know this
But everybody's wearing their hair
The way you did fifteen years ago
And it makes you wanna cry

Oh, it feels just like the eighties coming back
Can you feel it? It's the eighties coming back
Yeah, I know it's just the eighties coming
Eighties coming, eighties coming

Nanana,"It was a warm midsummer night

Takes 2 to Tango,"Time to leave
Time to feel
Harp and horn
Music's born
Two worlds meet
Hungry sharing a fantasy

Tail and wing
Soon will swing
Dusk till dawn
Let the show just begin
In a place where pardon stand
Giving feast on sacred land

The angels and devils meet at night, Hallelujah
They dance, they caress each other holding on so tight
The angels and demons side by side, Hallelujah
They dance until morning light
When nobody else is in sight
Takes two to tango, tango

Purified
Justified
Times of lust
Times of trust
Praising dark
For one moment in paradise

Passion flows
Eager grows
Time runs out, it's the end of the show
When the morning is at hand
Time has come to show their stand

The angels and devils meet at night, Hallelujah
They dance, they caress each other holding on so tight
The angels and demons side by side, Hallelujah
They dance until morning light
When nobody else is in sight
Takes two to tango

Angels falling, hear them calling
Demons rising, they're disguising
Hearts are beating
Secret meeting
Just for the moment in love

The angels and devils meet at night, Hallelujah
They dance, they caress each other holding on so tight
The angels and demons side by side, Hallelujah
They dance until morning light
When nobody else is in sight
Takes two to tango"

Dziesma par laimi,"When there is nothing else, I think that
I still have a song I can sing to you
About happiness we feel, about a road that goes
Like a train on metal rails To faraway stations on the North Pole
Where freedom lives, and nothing else
Each time when I feel miracles in the distance
I want to be closer to you Nothing, when there is nothing else
I want to sing you a song about happiness
That comes, that comes unexpectedly
And takes us by the hand
A song about happiness to come When there is nothing else, I think that
I still have the wind that runs up to the sky
And the sun that rises, faraway roads that cross
Seven mountains and nine seas To warmer lands like birds of passage
There everything is just like in a dream, but you are not there
Each time when I feel miracles in the distance
I want to be closer to you Nothing, when there is nothing else
I want to sing you a song about happiness
That comes, that comes unexpectedly
And takes us by the hand
A song about happiness to come Nothing, when there is nothing else
I want to sing you a song about happiness
That comes, that comes unexpectedly
And takes us by the hand
A song about happiness to come Nothing, when there is nothing else
I want to sing you a song about happiness
That comes, that comes unexpectedly
And takes us by the hand
A song to come
A song about happiness to come"
To Believe (Leha'amin) (להאמין),"To believe, to believe in all the good that's in this world
To believe, to believe that this world still has a chance
To believe in love, that the hope isn't lost
To believe To have a dream,
To have a dream that maybe
One day we can find the way.
To have a dream,
To have a dream that people help
Each other on a cloudy day.
To have a dream of you and me,
Living together feeling free,
To have a dream of love. To have a dream… To believe, to believe in all the good that's in this world
I do believe, I do believe that
Maybe one day we can find the way
I do believe that love will rise
And shine again before our eyes
I still believe in life To believe"
Jugarem a estimar-nos,"I have no doubts, neither of us knows
Why we are together tonight
You don't know my name
And truly, I don't know your name either.
Maybe it's better to think about nothing
Let's make the most of being alone
Let's forget all our problems
And let's enjoy this moment.
Tonight we'll make it our night
Tonight we'll be able to be whatever we want
While we wait for the sun to rise. I want us to be together,
that we don't stop playing
I want you to tell me ""I love you""
even though it's not true
I want us to embrace each other,
that we enjoy this moment
And play... we'll play we're loving each other And when tomorrow the sun gets you out of bed
I won't be by your side anymore
You will just be a memory
The dream of a midsummer night.
That night that we both had
So far from all reality
A night that we're living now
And we want it to last forever
Where nothing matters, but us
Tonight everything's permitted, I'll be whoever you want
While the sun doesn't turn up. I want us to be together,
that we don't stop playing
I want you to tell me ""I love you"",
even though it's not true
I want us to embrace each other,
that we enjoy this moment
And play... we'll play we're loving each other.
I want us to be together,
that we don't stop playing
I want you to tell me ""I love you"",
even though it's not true
I want us to embrace each other,
 that we enjoy this moment
And play... we'll play we're loving each other.
We are not in a hurry
But don't waste time
Because when the sun rises
The magic will disappear
The night is long
But we must make the most of it
I'll be whoever you want
Until the sun rises
Until the sun rises. I want us to be together,
that we don't stop playing
I want you to tell me ""I love you"",
even though it's not true
I want us to embrace each other,
that we enjoy this moment
And play... we'll play we're loving each other
I want us to be together,
that we don't stop playing
I want you to tell me ""I love you"",
even though it's not true
I want us to embrace each other,
that we enjoy this moment
And play... we'll play we're loving each other
Until the sun rises"
Foi magia,"I don't know how was it
I don't know what happened to me
But sunddenly I was there It was magic, It was magic And you were there
Smiling to me
I've never seen anything like this. It was magic, It was magic It was magic
When I touched you and the kiss I gave you,
It was magic, in that day,
It was magic, in that day. I don't know what happened to me
But something happened
It was something divinal. It was magic, It was magic I don't know how was it
what happened to me for what
I've never done any similar thing It was magic, It was magic It was magic
When I touched you and the kiss I gave you,
It was magic, in that day,
It was magic, in that day."
On Again... Off Again,"Look at me, I need some attention
I'm a girl, Of serious intention
Just like a butterfly
My wings can take me high
To touch your piece of sky
Though I can fly away
Play cool, or run away
I choose to hold your love
More than one night!

You're everything and nothing in one
(What do you mean?)
Our love goes from the North to the South
(I disagree)
I just can't understand anymore
What we have in common

On again... Off again
Like the rhythm of rain
We need to decide
Find an end to this game
Such wonderful times
Many natural highs
Love is a flame, that we can never tame
On again... Off again

Why, Oh why! Can't I live without you?
How, Oh how! Do I reach inside you?
My love is justified
I simply had enough
I want you by my side
Am I your fantasy?
Mystery? Or destiny?
Do you take me for a ride?
Please, tell me now!

You're the air, you're the love that I breathe
(That sounds so good)
You're the magic that flows from within
(I feel that too)
We come close then we move far away
Can't we stay together?

On again... Off again
Like the rhythm of rain
We need to decide
Find an end to this game
Such wonderful times
Many natural highs
Love is a flame, that we can never tame
On again... Off again

There's a river between us
And I need you to come across
Reach out for my heart
Keep this feeling so alive
Love grows, We survive

On again... Off again
Like the rhythm of rain
We need to decide
Find an end to this game
Such wonderful times
Many natural highs
Love is a flame, that we can never tame
On again... Off again

Off again... On again
Like a flickering flame
That dies in the wind
And lights up again
Such wonderful times
Many natural highs
Love is a flame, we can never tame
On again... Off again

On again... Off again"
Notre planète,"Take care of our planet, there are so many things to save
The madness of people, the storms have damaged it Who remembers the virgin coasts and white paradises?
Who remembers the blue oceans, whales and their songs? In this world where nothing more is sacred, so far from our values
Before the desert wipes out our dreams of colours Take care of our planet, there are so many things to save
May the madness of people stop, may our children be able to dream Their eyes turned to the stars, their hands stretched to the sky
May the winds carry their sails, may our steps guide their wings We have constructed prisons of glass on forests of ashes
We have transformed our universe without trying to understand it On our beaches flows ink, this is the blood of the earth
May those who give us orders hear our prayers We dream of a paradise on earth"
Shake It,"[Verse 1]
Every time you wanna play
Turn me on, all the way
Come to me and take the ride
Skin on skin, it's pure delight
Givin' me the passion you're burnin' my heart
Gonna rock you till you drop
Baby you're the reason I'm feelin' so hot
Want you now, I just can't stop

[Pre-Chorus]
I would trade my life
For a night with you
Driven by desire
Make that move on me
It's time for you to see
That my world's on fire!

[Chorus]
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it mi amor
Crazy for love
Give me some more
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it mi amor
Crazy for love
Give me some more
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it mi amor
Crazy for love
Give me some more
Forever!

[Verse 2]
Everyday I can't resist
Need the taste of your lips
Darlin' it's your body that drivin' me nuts
Let me in I've got to touch

[Pre-Chorus]
I would trade my life
For a night with you
Driven by desire
Make that move on me
It's time for you to see
That my world's on fire!

What's Happened to Your Love?,"What's happened to your love?
What's happened to my love?
We've been together for so long
But now the feeling's gone

What's happened to your love?
What's happened to my love?
We've been together for so long
But now the feeling's gone
But now the feeling's gone

Could you give me one more try?
I will never make you cry
Yes, I've made mistakes before
Give your hand let's go for more

Oh baby, you came back again
Your eyes are shining like a flame
I thought I might forget your touch
But now I love you so much

What's happened to your love?
What's happened to my love?
We've been together for so long
But now the feeling's gone

What's happened to your love?
What's happened to my love?
We've been together for so long
But now the feeling's gone
But now the feeling's gone

I do remember your first words
And silence's broken down my heart
I want to dream about sky blue
If I can darling stay with you

Let's walk we did it for the first time
Along the wavy sea shore line
Please smile you always did to me
Oh baby, tell what do you feel?

What's happened to your love?
What's happened to my love?
We've been together for so long
But now the feeling's gone

What's happened to your love?
What's happened to my love?
We've been together for so long

The Image of You,"How strange the feeling in your soul
When love invades your very being
Another me or so I'm told
And life takes on another meaning
Day after day, I go through the motions
Stumbling my way, life is a blur
Slave of my love, of my emotions
You're in my eyes, you're in my heart
One kiss, one heartbeat, in time
A kiss, the moment, is mine
I close my eyes, I breathe
I'm Queen of the world of Make Believe!!
You make me feel, a little crazy
You make me see your tears are true
You make my days and nights so hazy
You make me feel the image of you
Choir: You make me feel
Soloist: a little crazy
Choir: You make me see
Soloist: Your tears are true
Choir: You make me feel
Soloist: Image of you
I know it's just a dream
I feel, l love, this life"
Stronger Every Minute,"No matter where I am
Im always thinking of you
It may be hard but I need you to understand
That I dont often say what I feel
But now this is straight from my heart
My love grows stronger every minute
And it wont ever die
I want you to stay with me
Not just this day
But for all my life
Now when I look into your eyes
I can tell theres something wrong
Youre holding back the tears
Couldnt bear to lose you now
So I will make my feelings clear
My love grows stronger every minute
And it wont ever die
You must believe
Ill always be there for you
All my life
Oh please stay
My love grows stronger every minute
And it wont ever die
I want you to stay with me
Not just this day
But for all my life
Oh please stay

Life,"I saw my ID, and it wasn't me
It was someone else's identity
Why do I need to prove myself
Who is the judge of my sanity

Roaming through my old emotions
I find new feelings of misery
I bet with my soul to get back the truth
Where I will face reality

Life is a book and you gotta read it
Life is a story and you gotta tell it
Life is a song and you gotta sing it
You got to know how to live it

Life is a book and you gotta read it
Life is a story and you gotta tell it
Life is a song and you gotta sing it
You got to know how to live it

Walking around with some thoughts on my mind
I've searched for a place where I'll be free
From all that I said and all that's been done
It'll be hard to find it inside of me

Life is a book and you gotta read it
Life is a story and you gotta tell it
Life is a song and you gotta sing it
You got to know how to live it

Life is a book and you gotta read it
Life is a story and you gotta tell it
Life is a song and you gotta sing it
You got to know how to live it

I know that I've gotta try
No one can see me cry
I can't take it any more
I must find a way to let myself go

Life is a book and you gotta read it
Life is a story and you gotta tell it
Life is a song and you gotta sing it
You got to know how to live it

Life is a book and you gotta read it
Life is a story and you gotta tell it
Life is a song and you gotta sing it
You got to know how to live it

Life is a book and you gotta read it

Stay Forever,"Ooh... hey yeah yeah

C'mon, let's fly away, girl
Up on cloud number nine I'd wish to flow
You're my most precious pearl
Hmm... waiting for you, that's all I need to know

Wait and see how it's gonna be
Hold my hand, just don't let go
Birds of a feather flock together
But time will tell, people say, so

Stay forever and ever
You will always be my baby
Stay forever, I'll never hurt you
I won't make you cry, no, no, no

Stay forever, no matter what may happen
Don't give up on me
Do whatever, I'll never let go
I will catch your fall

Through our sunny and dark sides of life
Feelings like this are made to survive
What the rest of the world thinks doesn't matter
Because we know it better

Stay forever and ever
You will always be my baby
Stay forever, I'll never hurt you
I won't make you cry, no, no, no

Stay forever, no matter what may happen
Don't give up on me
Do whatever, I'll never let go
I will catch your fall

Stay forever and ever
You will always be my baby, baby
Stay forever, I'll never hurt you
I won't make you cry"
Tii,"Woke myself up
In the morning
With the roosters song
I was off and left the gate open
So that others may come. Can't sleep
The road goes on
We won't go around The pace is so great
That on the horizon
I can see my own toes Valleys edge, forest road, across the rivers, over the hills
We won't know where the road of life will turn Yesterday we were not here and
Today we came
And tomorrow we'll go again
The sun is shining
In all our hearts
And we feel great everywhere Today we came and
We are no fools
And tomorrow we'll go again
The sun is shining
In all our hearts
And we feel great everywhere Woke myself up... *start from beginning*"
You Are the Only One,"Eurovision 2004 - Croatia
Once again just hold me
Let me feel you breathe
Softly kiss me on my face
Love is all I need
Lonely moments, years
Nothing before you
Finally youre here
Our love is true
Hold me once again my dear
Let your passion take me
In my heart theres harmony
When youre close to me Even in my dreams
I really need to feel you
Forever well be one
Our love is true
(refrain:) You are the only one
Our love is timeless
When you are by my side
Im truly blessed with
With only happiness
I have to got someone
Someone of my own
A part of me
Who lives for me
Who would die for me"
Shame on You,"We've been together for the longest time
I always thought that I could read your mind
But lately we've been like two actors in a show
And I wonder, where's the loving that we used to know?

I hoped that everything would be all right
That you would be forever by my side
But all the feelings and the luck we used to share
Now it seems to me it's gone and that you just don't care

You're my fire, you're my desire, shame on you
Can't you see that we have gone too far?
Don't you leave me, don't you deceive me, shame on you
I just want to be where you are

You know I love you, though you cheat on me
You try to hide it, but it's plain to see
Make up your mind, 'cause I can't take it anymore
Won't you turn to me and tell me what you're waiting for?

You're my fire, you're my desire, shame on you
Can't you see that we have gone too far?
Don't you leave me, don't you deceive me, shame on you
I just want to be where you are

You're my fire, you're my desire, shame on you
Can't you see that we have gone too far?
Don't you leave me, don't you deceive me, shame on you
I just want to be where you are

You're my fire, you're my desire, shame on you
Can't you see that we have gone too far?
Don't you leave me, don't you deceive me, shame on you
I just want to be where you are

You're my fire, you're my desire, shame on you
Can't you see that we have gone too far?
Don't you leave me, don't you deceive me, shame on you
I just want to be where you are"
Lane moje (Лане моје),"When I think of you
I'm afraid I'll love you again

It is not important who with
Find someone like me
So that at least I don't love you"

Para llenarme de ti,"She stayed behind crying
crying her grief
and she knows it is because of you
her sentence today I loved her so much
she was the blood in my veins
not knowing that from someone else
were her full moons And between your love and her pain
There is a regret
I am burning over a low fire
I am burning over a low fire
but my heart said goodbye
and now again the sun shines
because you have given fire to my heart Today I was left empty to be filled with you
my haven will be your body
and my land your womb of wheat and flower Today I was left empty to be filled with you
and my caress will be your breath
and my flag the light of your sweet love I will love you until the end
I will give you all my love
And I will give you all my skin and my life
All for this love for your love And I will love you, I will love you without measure
And I will give you
I will even put my life at stake for this love, for this love Today she is so far away
like a footprint in the sand
her memory tastes like salt
and peppermint You ease me
on the nights of devotion
and no one else can ever wipe out
your skin of silk And between your love and her pain
There is a regret
I am burning over a low fire
I am burning over a low fire

Du bist,"This silence which I have, always when you're with me,
this pure imagination,
this power that you give only to me.
these small happy moments,
which you give me so numerously,
I always lose my words then,
because there's nothing without you. If you're sad, then I cry along with you.
If you sleep, then I dream along with you. You are the life I love,
you have the laughter I need.
You are the star on the star tent
and everything beautiful, too.
You are the power that surrounds me,
you are the warmth, you're the light.
And everything I still need, you also are. You are a hell of an optimist,
limits are unknown for you.
For you every wish is a goal,
and all dreams come true. If you're sad, then I cry along with you.
If you sleep, then I dream along with you. You are the life I love,
you have the laughter I need.
You are the star on the star tent
and everything beautiful, too.
You are the power that surrounds me,
you are the warmth, you're the light.
And everything I still need,
you also are. The air that gives me breath,
the wonder you call life.
The water that I don't die from thirst,
all that in one that's you."
High,"I have tried every way
To get to the heart of your soul
‘Cause everything that you deny
Could be there if you let me know

I wanna heal every wound in you
To finally make you believe

High, over the rain
There’s still a sun that could ease all your pain
I always try holding your heart
Bringing you high

Try to make you see the light
When sorrow grows deep in your mind
And seize the day, not asking why
There is so much for you to find

I wanna bring you the wings to fly
To never be broken again

Oh… high, over the rain
There’s still a sun that could ease all your pain
I always try, holding your heart
Bringing you high

I just wanna open your closing mind
Your life can’t be worth all your sacrifice
There is a light over you
Please let it through

High, over the rain
There’s still a sun that could ease all your pain
I always try, holding your heart
Bringing you high, oh…

High, over the rain
There’s still a sun that could ease all your pain
I always try, holding your heart
Bringing you high

Bringing you high"
À chaque pas,"With each step There are wounds
That we'll have to forget
Many a crossing-out
That we'll have to erase Blow hard enough for ressentment to fly away
And to knock down all our barriers With each step we'll take
With each gesture we will offer
It will be the start of a new tommorow
In each word we will utter
In that future we will build up
It is Love that our hands will shape There are abuses
We will have to forgive
Shouts against walls
That will knock them down Let's lay our arms down at our feet
So that our conflicts be only a whisper With each step we'll take
With each gesture we will offer
It will be the start of a new tommorow
In each word we will utter
In that future we will build up
It is Love that our hands will shape The fight will be long
But you know that it is worth it
The child in us will find the way There are cracks
That will remain broken
Some hardships
Marked forever With each step we'll take
With each gesture we will offer It is Love that our hands will shape"
Can't Wait Until Tonight,"Don't wanna talk about the way I am
I only try to make you understand
That my affection is so really true
And my heart has started thumpin'
Since I met you
I just can't wait until tonight, baby
'til I have you by my side, baby
I just can't wait until tonight, baby
For being with you
Do do do do do
First time I saw you it just knocked me down
The way you smiled has turned my life around
I never thought that it would catch me so
I'll get my head together cause
I want you to know
I just can't wait until tonight, baby
'til I have you by my side, baby
I just can't wait until tonight, baby
For being with you
Do do do do do
True love won't be afraid of no one
True love will lead us through the day
I'll get my head together

In one life, let us be free
One life, you take my troubles away
Light up my day

You came here, in the night
Took the worries off your mind
In your eyes, beneath your skin
I feel the pain you're in

We're not the same but, so much alike
You are my brother, my sister tonight
We've got...

One life, living together
In one life, let us be free
One life, you take my troubles away
Light up my day

One life, living together
In one life, let us be free
One life, you take my troubles away
Light up my day"
Believe Me,"Believe me, I just don't care
If you look away or stare
If you choose to go or stay
Don't believe me, I pray

In my head - every day, everywhere - oh, no
You and I can talk, and I sound colder
In my heart, though I say I don't care
I just cry and cry on your big shoulder

Believe me, I just don't care
If you look away or stare
If you choose to go or stay
Don't believe me, I pray

Believe me, I just don't care
If you look away or stare
If you choose to go or stay
Don't believe me, I pray

Far away, like the man in the moon - my dear
You just wave to me, you're always lying
Every face, every voice, every tune
Brings you back to me, and I start crying

Believe me, I just don't care
If you look away or stare
If you choose to go or stay
Don't believe me, I pray

Believe me, I just don't care
If you look away or stare
If you choose to go or stay
Don't believe me, I pray

Believe me, I just don't care"
Heaven,"I still miss you and it makes me feel blue
And I'm lost without those colours of you
I can't think straight, I just wanna be
Wherever you are when you're not here with me

Blend with my blue, those colours of you
Please help me see it through, oh...
This journey I must take alone
So just blend your colours with my blue

I lay down and cry, and the rivers are dry
Oh... to unveil my heart when you kiss me goodbye
And when you set sail, fair winds all the way
So farewell, that's all I can say

Mmm... blend with my blue, the colours of you
Oh... please help me see it through, oh...
This journey I must take alone
Oh... so just blend your colours with my blue

And I know I'll find my love tonight
I can feel you reachin' out
I got this feeling deep inside
It's in my head, it's in my heart

I know your love tonight
And I know you'll be by my side
I know you'll help me to see it through
Oh... blend your colours with my blue"
If My World Stopped Turning,"I could see my future
When I'm loking in your eyes
And I can sense security
Just by you being in my life

Little voice inside my head
Says you're an angel in disguise
Without you I feel hopeless
Without you I'm deprived

I wish I could describe it
All the love I feel inside
Maybe I can find the words
That would make you realize

My life seems near perfect
When I got you in my arms
That's when I feel wholesome
That's when I am with you

If my world stopped turning in the morning
And if God should take this all away
If it all should stop without a warning
I would still stand tall
'Cause behind it all
You're the one who's made a winner out of me

I lie alone to touch you
And it comes as a surprise
That we spend so long apart
Even more that I survived

If I could speak frankly
There's one thing I can say
That I'm falling for you, baby
Falling further every day

And if my world stopped turning in the morning
And if God should take this all away
If it all should stop without a warning
I would still stand tall
'Cause behind it all
You made me your winner

If my world stopped turning in the morning
And if God should take this all away
If it all should stop without a warning
I would still stand tall
'Cause behind it all
You're the one who's made a winner out of me"

Hold on to Our Love,"Maybe I've been foolish letting you down
I've been a little selfish not being around
But if I lost you, I'd be helpless inside
Gotta hold on to our love tonight

'Cause now that I've found that someone I believe in
And I feel so complete by your side
It's the only time I've ever loved somebody, baby, in my life
We gotta hold on to our love tonight

I know that you've been hurting
The pain's in your eyes
I promise you I'm changing, I feel it inside
I don't know what I would do if it all passes by
We gotta hold on to our love tonight

'Cause now that I've found that someone I believe in
And I feel so complete by your side
It's the only time I've ever loved somebody, baby, in my life
We gotta hold on to our love tonight

Some things in life we should treasure
When you find love, never let it go
Because now I realise and I want you to know

'Cause now that I've found that someone I believe in
And I feel so complete by your side
It's the only time I've ever loved somebody, baby, in my life
We gotta hold on to our love tonight

'Cause now that I've found that someone I believe in
And I feel so complete by your side
It's the only time I've ever loved somebody, baby, in my life
We gotta hold on to our love tonight
We gotta hold on to our love tonight"
For Real,"Ohh... Comin' up, comin' up, comin' up now
What you doing?
What you waiting for?
Ohh, it's time to push it, break it, rush it
Don't ever let life pass you by

All I know is you don't want to be part of the crowd
Realize yourself
You say it but don't feel it
What you're sayin' has no meanin'
Don't hide your soul
For real, I'm for real
Come on

Up, I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
Do you want, do you want
Up, I wanna bring you up, up
I wanna bring you up

Please, please
No questions, no answers
No more runnin' around in circles
Are you in, are you out?
Do you know your way out?
Let me take you up, into sky
For real, I'm for real
Come on

Up, I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
Do you want, do you want
Up, I wanna bring you up, up
I wanna bring you up

I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
I wanna bring you up
Do you want, do you want
Up, I wanna bring you up, up
I wanna bring you!

Come on
Come on
Risin' up now, risin' up now..."
I Admit,"As in a dream, love appeared
Swept me away and made me lose control like never before
As in a dream, love touched me
I felt how it touched the bottom of my very soul

Now I know I find the key to my heart
I just hope this ain't a dream and that you are reality

I admit I fell for you so badly
And I admit you make my senses wild
I know sometimes I am looking foolish, I admit, I admit
I'll be your fool as long as you are mine, yes mine, just mine

It's good to be in love
It makes you touch the sky a thousand times or more
It's good to admit
That my heart starts to race when you walk through that door

Now I know you are the key to my heart
Just hope you're not a dream and that you'll be my everything

I admit I fell for you so badly
And I admit you make my senses wild
I know sometimes I am looking foolish, I admit, I admit
I'll be your fool as long as you are mine, yes mine, just mine

I admit I fell for you so badly, and I feel so good
And I admit you make my senses wild
I know sometimes I might act and look foolish, I admit, I admit
I'll be your fool as long as you are mine, yes mine, just mine

Just mine
You make me shine
You are the light in my life

I admit I fell for you so badly, and I feel so good
And I admit you make my senses wild
I know sometimes I am looking foolish, I admit, I admit
I'll be your fool as long as you are mine, yes mine, just mine

I admit I fell for you so badly, and I feel so good
And I admit you make my senses wild, oh yeah
I know sometimes I might act and look foolish, I admit, I admit
I'll be your fool as long as you are mine, yes mine, just mine, all right
Mine, yes mine, just mine
Just mine"
It Hurts,"Nobody but me
Could know the way I feel

I'm standing on a roof-top
And I'm crying out your name
I'm looking for an answer
And for somebody to blame
'Cause even though it's over
You linger on my mind
Oohh

Hurts, oh it hurts, really hurts
In the middle of the night
In the light of the day
You know that it hurts, oh it hurts, really hurts
And I wish I could be stronger
No longer afraid
Nobody but me
Could know the way I feel
How it hurts
Oh, it hurts

I'm trying to forget love
The pain I feel inside
I'm clinging to my pillow
And the tears I cannot hide
I wish it could be over
So I could start anew
Oohh

Hurts, oh it hurts, really hurts
In the middle of the night
In the light of the day
You know that it hurts, oh it hurts, really hurts
And I wish I could be stronger
No longer afraid
Nobody but me
Could know the way I feel
How it hurts
Ooohh

Not easy to remember
And even harder to forget
Whenever I surrender, ohh
You're always on my mind

Hurts, oh it hurts, really hurts
In the middle of the night
In the light of the day
You know that it hurts, oh it hurts, really hurts
And I wish I could be stronger
No longer afraid
Nobody but me
Could know the way I feel
How it hurts
Oh, it hurts (Oh, it hurts)

I wish I could be stronger
Mmm, but it hurts (Hurts, oh it hurts, oh it hurts)"
Y así,"D'you know the girl who came from Cuba?
She loves our music and our songs
She came and she saw
Austrians dance quite slow
Her shaking hips were inspiration
To change the rhythm of our songs
So now, here's the chance
To see how she would dance

Bailar como Latina
El ritmo puro de la música alpina
Bailar como Latina
El ritmo puro de la música alpina

Y así, y así
Y así baila la chica del Caribe
Y así, y así
Y así baila la chica del Caribe

The second part of our story:
The girl from Cuba fell in love
The boy she'd adore
Could dance and sing and more

He was the master of the yodel
His (Hodl-o-ii-dii...) was unique
Oh, he was so smart
She danced and won his heart

Bailar como Latina
El ritmo puro de la música alpina
Bailar como Latina

Little by Little,"Night shadows falling
I hear you calling
We're finally talking
Your words touch my soul

It's taken a long time
To get inside your mind
I know it's not easy
But baby, we're two of a kind

Ooh... little by little
I'm getting close to your heart
When we're together
Looks like we're making a start

Little by little
I see that look in your eyes
Each time you touch me
I want to reach out for you

No more confusion
It ain't no illusion
This is a fusion
Of body and mind

We're meant for each other
So baby, come on, hold me tight
We'll make it together
As we fly into the night

Ooh... little by little
I'm getting close to your heart
When we're together
Looks like we're making a start

Little by little

Amar,"Sometimes the sky runs away
To look for another way
Where the sun doesn't fit in
And the moon doesn't want to stay

From sea to sea, hey
To see and conquer, hey
To love, to love
Always, always, anyway
From sea to sea, hey
To see and conquer, hey
To love, to love
Always, day by day

Only those who don't want to love
Look without seeing

Happy pretty way, happy shiny day
Happy place to stay, we can hold it together
Happy pretty way, happy shiny day
Happy place to stay, we can hold it forever

Pretty people shining, a pretty place to stay
Brand new kind of face, I love you anyway
Fight for the love that I miss, ask me to stay

Happy pretty way, happy shiny day
Happy place to stay, we can hold it together
Happy pretty way, happy shiny day
Happy place to stay, we can hold it forever

Happy pretty way, very shiny day
Happy place to stay, we can hold it together
Happy pretty way, happy shiny day
Happy place to stay, we can hold it forever

From sea to sea
To see and conquer
To love, to love
Ask me to stay
To love

(Happy pretty way, happy shiny day)
(Happy place to stay, we can hold it together)
(Happy pretty way, happy shiny day)

Pretty way, happy, happy shiny day
A brand new day, happy, happy place to stay
Pretty way, happy, happy shinny day
A brand new day, happy, happy place to stay"

Never seen that hit - bunica beat da drum-a
Big mallet in the hand, high hat in the same beat
She's screaming like Hawkins, my old big mama
Bunica beat da drum-a like I never heard before
She's a slapping miss Blackman, gimme some more
Check it, let's kick it, we wanna dance now
We are turning into hammers ticking rhythm out

Now get your body moving, just follow the tune
It's a real magic - big mama play her drum-a
She's flying into trance like an Indian shaman
Who's the Beatles? Where from is Peter Pan?
Who's the gypsy Jimmy Hendrix?
She don't care, that misses L

Dizzy tempo dizzy, let's go my music mama

Pop you up with dat beat
Get rid of rotten meat
You dig with your soul
Deep inside that rock 'n' roll

Drain a bottle of wine, no need to roll the leaves
By the end of dat show you will blow yourself to bits

The War Is Not Over,"Ta na na na... na na...
Na na na... na na...

I slowly walk into the night around
To see how dreams of people die
They gently fall from windows all around
And crash against the ground like glass
And I'm so sorry I'm so helpless in this angry world
If only I could change it for one day

The war is not over, everyone knows it
It's just a reason to make us believe
That someone's the loser, someone's the winner
To make us believe that's the way it should be
But I don't wanna believe

In the story they all tell this fairy tale has gone too far
I take a step and dare myself to be free
To see how beautiful we are, that everyone can be a star
If only we would start believe in dreams
Believe in who we are

The war is not over, everyone knows it
It's just a reason to make us believe
That someone's the loser, someone's the winner
To make us believe that's the way it should be
But I don't wanna believe

But I don't wanna believe
No, no, no, but I don't wanna believe"
Tout de moi,"I'd give the dearest I have
I could even say some prayers
I'd learn to become the one
You want me to become
I'd face storms and winds
I'd shout out my feelings
To mix our roads
I'd become your angel All of me
I lay my hours and my weapons down at your feet
When everything already
Reminds me that I'm nothing without you Yes, all of me
I give you all my dreams, my heart and my soul
When everything already
Reminds me that I don't exist without you In this town where everything talks about us
The memory of our dates are left
I hang up words full of hope
Waiting for the evening wind I have nights that look like years
I've lost sleep by dreaming too much
I've shouted against walls
But nothing puts my mind at ease All of me
I lay my hours and my weapons down at your feet
When everything already
Reminds me that I'm nothing without you And if the gods are against us
Then I would be an adjutant
I would hunt the cold winters
Like a queen of hearts defends her king
Oh whoa Oh oh All of me
I lay my hours and my weapons down at your feet
When everything already
Reminds me that I'm nothing without you"
Hasheket shenish'ar (השקט שנשאר),"I was like a blind in the daylight,
All logic and no room for anything else.
I tremble beside you
And the drug within me hasn't ended yet,
I breathe you in, but the taste is already bitter. The gaze is different, and the cold seeps in,
You're hiding, breaking my body,
The gaze is different, and the cold seeps in,
And another day goes by without breath. Night comes slowly, time stands still,
Night, and you're the remaining silence,
One moment, and I'm falling with you
At the end of the game."
Love Me Tonight,"I wish you could be near me
I seek your eyes to thrill me
So take your chance and feel me
I am ready now

(I dream of you by my side) Move closer, baby
(You've got a place in my mind) I'm with you, baby
(Do it to me one more time) I'm waiting, baby
Give me the time of my life

Love me tonight and I'll love you forever
It's no sin, it's no crime that I want you mine
Love me tonight, I need you more than ever
You can make me feel right, just love me tonight
Love me tonight

I've got no hesitation
It's my infatuation
Your touch is an obsession
I'm addicted now

(I dream of you by my side) Move closer, baby
(You've got a place in my mind) I'm with you, baby
(Do it to me one more time) I'm waiting, baby
Give me the time of my life

Love me tonight, I need you more than ever
You can make me feel right, just love me tonight

(Do it to me one more time)

My Impossible Dream,"I have a dream...

You 'n' me, we're driftin' far apart
Our story has been told
Can't you see, the writing's on the wall?
I've come in from the cold
And I will follow my dream

I'll fight the big wide world
I'll make it on my own
Against all odds I'm breakin' free
The gauntlet has been thrown
My colours have been shown
Now I seek my impossible dream

Now's the time
To hold my head up high
Find my identity
So I will follow my dream

I'll fight the big wide world
I'll make it on my own
Against all odds I'm breakin' free
The gauntlet has been thrown
My colours have been shown
Now I seek my impossible dream

My dream...

I'll fight the big world
I'll make it on my own again
Against all odds I'm breakin' free
The gauntlet has been thrown
My colours have been shown
Now I seek my impossible dream"
If I Had Your Love,"If I had your love
You would be what most inspires me
Sacred soul, fantasy, brightest light
Guiding me on wings

You would be the heart inside me
What I'd wish on a star
All to me, that is what you are

If I had your love
I could live my dream
Flying high above everything
If I had your love
You would light my world
That would be enough
If I had your love

Oh... if I held you close
Feeling your heart beat beside me
Fast asleep, wide awake, every step
Every move I make

If I had your love
I could live my dream
Flying high above everything
If I had your love
You would light my world
That would be enough
If I had your love

If I had your love
I'd live out my dream
Flying high above
Oh yeah...

If I had your love
I could live my dream
Flying high above everything

If I had your love

Le grand soir,"Tonight, all these looks
There in the dark, fear and hope
Tonight, it's not too late
To believe in dreams of glory
Tonight, a light
In a flash, to change history
Tonight, I prayed for it
I waited for it, the big night

Tonight, short of breath
With high commitment, not to disappoint
Tonight, to change sidewalk
Tonight, a new start
And to see his entire life
All his friends in a glance
Tonight, I make a wish
I want for them, the big night

Tonight, we all forget
The bad paths, the misty nights
Tonight, it's another day
Tonight, it's my turn at last
To have, as a Sunday
A revenge and the power
Tonight, to call it, to sing it
The big night, oh...
The big night"

In My Dreams,"Come on, come on, come on

Love is all over me (Over me)
You are the only one
Livin' in my fantasy, in my dreams

Scared of waking up and you'll be gone

Let Me Try,"When I find you in my dreams
You always try to run away
It doesn't look it, but it seems
You still take my breath away

And when I try to ask you why
We couldn't give it one more try
I can't find you anywhere
You're not there

Let me try, let me try
I don't wanna say goodbye
I will find a way to make you stay
Just let me try

Looking back, I realise
We are learning from mistakes
I can see it in your eyes
I can feel your heartbeat breaks

But when I try to ask you why
We couldn't give it one more try
I can't find you anywhere
You are not there

Let me try, let me try
I don't wanna say goodbye
I will find a way to make you stay
Just let me try

Let me try, let me try
I don't wanna say goodbye
I will find a way to make you stay
Just let me try

Let me try, let me try
I don't wanna say goodbye
I will find a way to make you stay
Just let me try

Oh world, please don't play with me,

But don't you be disappointed,
You have every other heart Hájnáne náne ná
Hájnáne náne ná
How I wish to be in another place
Hájnáne náne ná
Hájnáne náne ná
I can't see the light, and I won't be waiting for you
Hájnáne náne ná
Hájnáne náne ná
I'll disappear, and you will not find me
Hájnáne náne ná
Hájnáne náne ná
My sorrow will only be a bad dream."
Why,"In the night, there's a candle burning
Little light full of ache and yearning
For the child who won't be returning
And all the loved ones left behind
Morning breaks with the news of violence
Nothing moves in the haze of silence
Deep inside it feels like a riot
Oh, where can I find peace of mind?
(And they say that our trouble's just begun)
Tell me how
(Tell me how much we'll lose before we've won)
These tears won't dry
So I'm asking
Why? Why?
Will we ever find the answers?
Why? Why?
Why can't love be all that matters?
Why? Why?
While we try to understand
Faith and hope are slipping through our hands
Can you tell me why?
What's the secret to make things better?
Where's the thread holding us together?
How do we find the key that lets us
Open up our hearts and minds?
Winds of faith blow us past our limits
Spend our lives searching for forgiveness
Can one voice really make a difference?
Still I know we've got to try
(And they say that our trouble's just begun)
Tell me how
(Tell me how much we'll lose before we've won)
These tears won't dry
So Im asking
Why? Why?
Will we ever find the answers?
Why? Why?
Why can't love be all that matters?
Why? Why?
While we try to understand
Faith and hope are slipping through our hands
(Tell me why)
Tears are falling down like rain
A flood of questions come
Wheres the healing for this pain?
Is really love so hard to find?
So Im asking
Why? Why?
Will we ever find the answers?
Why? Why?
Why cant love be all that matters?
Why? Why?
While we pray to understand
Faith and hope are slipping through our hands
Tell me why"
Make My Day,"Ley lala ley la...

Day after day, time after time
You just try to make me cry
Hand in your hand, tears in my eyes
I pretend you make me fly

But honestly, it's plain to see
I'm not the man to be
Your cuddly toy, I am the boy
Who will break up with you to be free

Make my day, get away
Take it all, baby, please go
Try to play another way
Or I will find another love

Ley lala ley la...

Day after day, time after time
You just try to make me cry
But don't you see that I am the boy
Who will break up with you to be free?

Make my day, get away
Take it all, baby, please go

Or I will find another love
(Make my day) Shake it now, baby

Make my day, get away
Take it all, baby, please go
Try to play another way
Or I will find another love

Make my day, get away
Take it all, baby, please go
Try to play another way
Or I will find another love

La mirada interior,"If you want to find,the beauty of life
Go and search for it inside your heart

Go and explore inside your inner universe
There you will see a strength which makes
Everything stay where it is

Irradiate light
Irradiate harmony, be yourself If you want to find, the beauty of life

The doors of the treasure
Which is hidden inside your heart,
Don't doubt it
Bathe in the calmness
of the clear water
Where you will find the essence of the one you want to be Look within If you want to find, the beauty of life
Go and search for it inside your heart

Cool Vibes,"Don't want you to lead me to the dark
Don't need you to tear my heart apart
Don't do that, though people say that you're my enemy
I know you can set me free

Don't want you to come so close to me
Don't need you to blow my fantasy
But I know that you are livin' far beyond those lies
I can see the danger rise in your eyes

Cool vibes, why don't you kill me
Cool vibes, why don't you turn your eyes away
Can't you see we're free to die
Cool vibes, all we can do is fight and pray

Cool vibes, why don't you thrill me
Cool vibes, why don't you kill me
All that I can see are shadows of my destiny

Don't want you to make me feel afraid
Don't need you to take away the hate
But I know that you will break the seal of mystery
Leave it to my fantasy, what will be

Cool vibes, why don't you kill me
Cool vibes, why don't you turn your eyes away
Can't you see we're free to die
Cool vibes, all we can do is fight and pray

Cool vibes, why don't you thrill me
Cool vibes, why don't you kill me
All that I can see are shadows of my destiny

Stay close to me, infinity
Enigma's what we share
But I don't care
You'll be there

Cool vibes, why don't you kill me
Cool vibes, why don't you turn your eyes away
Can't you see we're free to die
Cool vibes, all we can do is fight and pray
(For some broken heroes)

Cool vibes, why don't you thrill me
Cool vibes, why don't you kill me
All that I can see are shadows of my destiny"
Vukovi umiru sami,"The silence like anchor ties the dark,
and my fear is slowly melting away,
the love, nothing but a phantom,
time wasn't right for me. There are still hours 'till the dawn
as I grow restless as if it was war,
i am puting my coat on and leaving this place,
leaving to forget everything. Ref.
The ships are sailing Danube again,
as you don't think about me any more,
a mere leaf I am, the wind carries me away,
the wolves always die alone. The silence like anchor ties the dark,
and my fear is slowly melting away,
the love, nothing but a phantom,
time wasn't right for me. Ref.
On Danube, Danube,
Danube, Danube"
Lorraine,"Standing here alone again
Waiting for the moment that we've shared, my love
No matter how many lies you say
No matter how many miles you walk away from me, Lorraine

Here I am, all alone, waiting for the moment again
But I know that you're gone

You've got to know that harder the rain, sweeter the pain
I can still remember, Lorraine, in the rain
Calling you, again and again, I'll wait for your name
I can still remember Lorraine in the rain

Whispering your name again, saying prayers
Among the stars, for you, my sweet Lorraine
You've always given me some great time
Try to imagine how we fly so far away from here, my love

Here I am, all alone, waiting for the moment we've shared
But I know that you're gone

You've got to know that harder the rain, sweeter the pain
I can still remember, Lorraine, in the rain
Calling you, again and again, I'll wait for your name
I can still remember Lorraine in the rain"
Love?,"Love can build you up, love can tear you down
Love can change the world - this is what I've found
Love can make you happy, love can make you cry
Love can be the best until it's passed you by

Do you wanna, do you wanna
Do you wanna fall in love?
Do you need it? Can you feel it?
Do you think you're strong enough?

Can you take the highs? Can you take the lows?
Can you handle everything love throws?

Love can build you up, love can tear you down
Love can change the world - this is what I've found
Love can make you happy, love can make you cry
Love can be the best until it's passed you by

If you want it, come and get it
Even though you know the score
I will love you, I will hate you
Then I'll love you even more

Can you handle love? Can you handle pain?
Can you handle everything I'm sayin'?

Love can build you up, love can tear you down
Love can change the world - this is what I've found
Love can make you happy, love can make you cry
Love can be the best until it's passed you by
(Love, love, love)

Love will capture you whole with your body and soul
Love is taking control of your senses
Love is guilty as tried, love has no alibi
Love is breaking down all your defences
Love...

Love can make you sorry, love can make you weep
Love can take you over even when you sleep
Love can give you heaven, love can make you high
Love can make you cheat and love can make you lie

Love can build you up, love can tear you down
Love can change the world - this is what I've found
Love can make you happy, love can make you cry
Love can be the best until it's passed you by"
Stop,"I lean on a dusty wall,
I fight with all my strength.
I knock and hope that you dont even hear me,
But you open the door like you don't even care. Why are we both pretending?
You're signed with his kiss. Go on, tie my hands up, so i'll drown,
to bleed out in your lap in lies.
At least tell me Stop when i look into your eyes,
at least tonight. Go on, tie my hands up, so i'll drown,
to bleed out in your lap in lies.
At least tell me Stop when i look into your eyes,
at least defend me tonight. For a long time you've been hiding with kisses between the palms,
And with a heavy heart you doubt the two of us.
Wipe me like dust, demolish everything under your fingers,
so i won't trip over the hope. Go on, tie my hands up, so i'll drown,
to bleed out in your lap in lies.
At least tell me Stop when i look into your eyes,
at least defend me tonight, defend me. Lalala lajla…

Talking to You,"""Eurovision 2005 - Denmark""
You nailed me to the floor with just one look I´ll sail any ocean

Angel,"Far away in a lost world
I hear your voice calling for heaven
Cast away, caught in mem'ries
You must believe love will come through

I'll be your angel in your darkest night
I'll be your destiny, waiting by your side
I'll be the sunshine when you're feeling blue
I'm always here for you

Comes a day, heart on fire
When all your faith seems to be missing
Go your way and you'll find there
A land of hope, a land of dreams

I'll be your angel in your darkest night
I'll be your destiny, waiting by your side
I'll be the sunshine when you're feeling blue
I'm always here for you

And when you lose it all
And nothing seems right
Just keep holding on
To me

I'll be your angel in your darkest night
I'll be your destiny waiting by your side
I'll be the sunshine when you're feeling blue
I'm always here for you"

Oh, mother bless me pleaaaaase dont you cry
Tomorrow i go
The last night falling
Oh, do you recall
How i would imagine
A white wedding dress
And now finally my time
Time is here
I know that i will miss
Your sweet words singing
Maybe ill cry
Still i hope you will sing
Sing for me
Di di da di di da
Lift the drum beat, raise your voice
Di di da di di da
May the whole world shake as one
Let the song begin
Celebrate the dance within

I will walk out this door
With the first star of night
Its time to say goodbye
Give me now
Your golden tear
Your sweet words singing
Maybe ill cry
Still i hope you will sing - sing for me"

Brujería,"Witchcraft
In every corner of my home
In every thing that happens to me
I feel his presence looking at me
I look in every corner
I search in every drawer
Messing up everything until I find my soul
And I surrender to him
And I don't know what to do
Love dominates me
I don't want to go out
I don't want to eat
I don't want to live another adventure
I get hot with your body
I feed myself with your kisses
Because you are my only madness
And I don't know what to do
I believe
That it is witchcraft
There's no cure for my soul
I only desire your warm body
And you look like a burning fire
That penetrates me all, all
And I become the target of your witchcraft
There's no cure for my soul
You dominate me with only one look
And you don't need ropes to tie me up
I'm a beast that doesn't escape for love
Although you open the grills
(Le le ley le)

There aren't antidotes nor ointments
Neither cures from once upon a time
That can take this obsession out of my head
There's neither a fantastic owl
Nor wings of a muse
Even if they're cooked with melons and cherries
And I don't know what to do
I believe
That it is witchcraft
There's no cure for my soul
I only desire your warm body
And you look like a burning fire
That penetrates me all, all
And I become the target of your witchcraft
There's no cure for my soul
You dominate me with only one look
And you don't need ropes to tie me up

Watching our worlds collide

Baby, gotta see you as you are
Wipe the rest of yearning out of my heart
And try
To say that last goodbye
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

Call Me,"Call me

I used to think that we could never make it
That million hearts could never beat as one

Different flags, but nations gathered
From the north to the south, all standing side by side

There was laughter and there was crying
But after all, I'm not denying
I'm so happy to be here, 'cause it's the time of my life

Sing with me, it's how it should be

Fifty candles on the forty cakes

Without Your Love,"Drumming hearts and your silent words of love
They still remain in the shades of night
Will you go? Will you ever save my storming soul?
I need to know

Should I live, should I die without your love?
Should I smile, should I cry without your love?
Should I fall, should I fly without your love?
All I can is only living for you, breathing for you

What I lose, what I find without your love?
What I say, what I hide without your love?
What I have in my mind without your love?
Tell me what I have to do, since I love you

Fly with me, take my wings and dream away
The stars will lead to the heavens' way
One's for sure:
There's a thousand ways to say goodbye
What you'll decide?

Should I live, should I die without your love?
Should I smile, should I cry without your love?
Should I fall, should I fly without your love?

Mr Nobody,"You, you came to me one night
Just like a ray of light
I thought we'd be forever

Now it's so clear to me
I'm part of history
You're leaving me in sorrow

So deeply, so badly, you're hurting me

Tell me - who's that lucky hero
Sleeping tightly on your pillow?
Ah... tell me - will it be forever?

'Cause when you look at me
I'm Mister Nobody
It's just a game you play
Can't let you walk away

Like a stranger passing by
With no more tears to dry
You're leaving me in sorrow

So deeply, so badly, you're hurting me

Tell me - who's that lucky hero
Sleeping tightly on your pillow?
Ah... tell me - will it be forever?

'Cause when you look at me

Sense tu,"I never felt at the end of the way before
And now I know it is
There is nothing we could save
Now I know that this time I lost the game
The end arrived.
And I know there is no solution
I'll look for a reason to walk out of this world without you Without you, without you,
from feeling in heaven, I went to hell
Without you, without you
The nights alone in my bed are so long
Without you, without you
And I don't know how I could escape
I want to get away from reality
Forget my past, simply walk on
Even though I know that at the end I will win. Forgetting you hurt me
Not wanting to know about what happened
It's difficult to know that what is waiting for me is hard
Without you by my side.
I know that I can't dream
past passed and doesn't come back
I need to look forward, I need to learn to love
Without you. Without you, without you,
from feeling in heaven, I went to hell
Without you, without you,
The nights alone in my bed are so long
Without you, without you
And I don't know how I could escape
I want to get away from reality
Forget my past, simply walk on
Even though I know that at the end I will win. Without you, without you
From feeling in heaven, I went to hell
Without you, without you
I lost this game, forgetting what I am
Without you, without you.
Now I know that I'm able to escape
I'm able to get away from reality
Forget my past, simply walk on
Even though you know that at the end, I won
Without you, without you, without you."

Zjarr e ftohtë,"Im fading away, ive forgotten you
Dont burden my days anymore
Everything is meaningless
I dont understand
I`m getting tired, ive forgotten you
I kill with time the memories
In fire we are cold
You have to leave, kill me
I see you and you blind me
We are in fire and we search for coldness
We are in a bad situation
I stop myself
I`m scared of my heart that loves you. I feel
Cold fire
I cant anymore
Ive lost my faith with you
My love, help me
To get away because i love you
Cold fire
Im getting tired for nothing
Im close to your lips
Im melting there
Because my heart feels you Everything is meaningless
My heart tries to find a station
It stops at you
Because all thoughts,dreams
Live in you
I want to kiss you but i cant
I cant understand
My life without you
I`m scared of my heart that loves you. I feel
Cold fire
I cant anymore
Ive lost my faith with you
My love, help me
To get away because i love you
Cold fire
Im getting tired for nothing
Im close to your lips
Im melting there
Because my heart feels you"

Every Song Is a Cry for Love,"Every song is a cry for love

Every song is a cry for love
Every voice can rise above
So don't be afraid
Just show what you're made of
Sing it out: every song is a cry for love

Every day is a brand new start
Every night you could fall apart
Anytime you doubt the truth that's in your heart
Sing it out: every song is a cry for love

Being strong, being tough
Never tender, always rough
It was never enough for me

In the dead of the night
Only love can hold you tight
Sing it out: every song is a cry for love

Every kiss is a call for home
Every touch means you're not alone
You don't always have to make it on your own
Sing it out: every song is a cry for love

Being strong, being tough
Never tender, always rough
It was never enough for me

In the dead of the night
Only love can hold you tight

Sing it out: every song is a cry for love
Every song is a cry for love"
Why Angels Cry,"When I'm feeling down in this world of madness
You comfort all my sadness, you soothe away my pain
'Cause these are trying times filled with so much sorrow
I wonder if tomorrow will bring a brighter day

Why do the angels cry? Why doesn't love survive?
Why do we all just pretend?
Why do the angels cry? Innocent children die
When will it all ever end, ever end?

Close your eyes and dream, and visualise a rainbow
Oh, a place where you can pray for peace and harmony
Search your heart and find a higher meaning
Let this be the start, a brand new beginning

Oh... talking 'bout peace and harmony
Oh...

(Why do the angels cry?) Why do they cry?
(Why doesn't love survive?)
(Why do we all just pretend?) Just pretend?
Why do the angels cry? Innocent children die
When will it all ever end, ever end?"
La coco-dance,"Underneath the caress of the sun
Between the sky and the sea, forget your problems
And if life leads you up the garden path

And your heart is empty, your happiness is gone
I have what you need to heal yourself
A little move, well balanced Move, move your hands, your body and your back
Let me sway until the end of the summer
Move, move your hands, your body and your back
To the music that makes us fall in love Hey oh, coco dance
It's the music of love

It's the dance of love (Ah...)
Tahiti to the Windward Islands
The golden sand on my tanned skin
We are much closer to paradise

Never Let You Go,"[Verse 1]
Heavy clouds, no rain
And every move causes pain
Ready kiss, but no love
I feel I'm torn in half
Ardent look, but no heat
It's not you really need

Baby, now it's happened with us
We are dancing on broken glass
Can't stand no more

Never, never let you go

Flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone
Love's carving it in the stone
Never, never let you go
Return the days we had before
Soul of my soul, blood of my blood
Love's carving it in my heart

[Verse 2]
Gentle words, no aim
It seems we're playing a game
Easy smile, but no fun
Sweet music for no one
Close embrace, but no more
Cold Champagne we forgot to pour

Baby now it's happened with us
We are dancing on broken glass
Can't stand no more

Never, never let you go

Through My Window,"When life is a road goin' nowhere
I'm alone, though you're gonna be right here
You're my baby
When life is a road goin' somewhere
All alone, I have to hold on to go on

I'm lookin' through my window
What about the sun you made shine?
What about the rain you cried on my pillow?

I'm lookin' through my window
What about us? Tell me why
I still can't see where's the rainbow

And maybe somebody someday
Turns back home, but it's gonna be a long way
It's been a long day
And maybe somebody someway
Highs and lows, it's always the same thing anyway

I'm lookin' through my window
What about the sun you made shine?
What about the rain you cried on my pillow?

I'm lookin' through my window
What about us? Tell me why
I still can't see where's the rainbow

I can't find the words, lose my nerve
And grass just turns to stone (Grass just turns to stone)
When all hopes are high, I have my pride
Show you what I'm really like inside

What about the sun you made shine?
What about the rain you cried on my pillow?

I'm lookin' through my window

i know i won't be there (amongst them)
it is easy to forgive sorrows
but never love
could you love another Ref.

If We All Give a Little,"Everybody has a dream
What will come and what will be
And hopes it soon will be reality

But a dream is not enough
There's so much we gotta do
To overcome the bitter blue

'Cause we all know one hand alone
Can never move a rock of stone
It takes us all, me and you

If we all give a little, if we all give a little
We can make this world a home for everyone
If we all give a little, we can dry a million tears
And some hope will grow out of many fears

Everybody has some strength
They could spend on someone weak
Don't let life be a game of hide-and-seek

Everyone has things to give
To someone just to carry on
And with our help, to overcome

We all have learnt a word alone
Can never touch a heart of stone
It takes much more, more of us

If we all give a little, if we all give a little
We can make this world a home for everyone
If we all give a little (If we all give a little)
We can dry a million tears
And some hope will grow out of many fears

If we give a little love
Just believe it's really worth
Many million hearts are beating on this earth

If we all give a little, if we all give a little
We can make this world a home for everyone (For everyone)
If we all give a little, we can dry a million tears

And some hope will grow (It will grow forever)
Out of many fears (If we stand together)
If we give a little, just a little
(If we give a little love) Give a little love

If we all give a little
(Just a little love)
All give a little
(A little) Love"

I Hear Your Heart,"In a world that is beeping and blaring
Growing louder every day
I cover my ears
But none of the noise will go away (Away)

Sirens, barking dogs
Thank God for the one and only sound
That turns around and makes it right

I hear your heart whisper to me
No matter where I may happen to be, yeah
Sending me love and shining it through
I hear your heart, can you hear mine too?

I hear your heart whisper to me
No matter where I may happen to be, yeah
Sending me love and shining it through
I hear your heart, can you hear mine too?

Oh, as sensitive people we're trampled
Almost everywhere we go
There are days (When we will die) when we'll die
If one more stranger tells us no

So I hope your shadows melt away
As you say they've done before
Just like the one and only sound
That turns around for me once more

I hear your heart whisper to me
No matter where I may happen to be
Sending me love and shining it through
I hear your heart, can you hear mine too?

I hear your heart whisper to me
No matter where I may happen to be
Sending me love and shining it through
I hear your heart, can you hear mine too?

I hear your heart
Mine too?
I hear your heart

A violin on a summer night
On a full moon mountain top
Couldn't sound as sweet as you do
Don't stop, don't stop

I hear your heart whisper to me
No matter where I may happen to be
Sending me love and shining it through
I hear your heart, can you hear mine too?

I hear your heart whisper to me
No matter where I may happen to be
Sending me love and shining it through
I hear your heart, can you hear mine too?"
Alvedansen,"Only you can read my soul
Warm me and make me whole
Breathe life into everything that I am
Come here and be close to me Only I can capture(?) your glance
Sagacious claws in the kiss you got
Tease you so you turn into fire
Come here, I know you want to AA
Come along in the summer night
AA
Nothin is hidden tonight Only I know everything that you are
Give you sparks, I can see that you're near
Float with me
Let everything turn into fire
Come here, I know you want to No one knowa
The wind is playing
The moon looks away
And we are everything"
Un Blodymary,"One Bloody Mary, please I swear to Dior that I didn’t want to, but he’s stuck on me
Everything was clean and certain
I was the other woman, the fool, he’s a bastard
A mediocre show-off I made myself marvellous, I dumped him
Wicked Martini boy
The unfortunate boy has a lot of fiery words
But this one’s not going to deceive me I may be from an underground slum
But my heart has declared to you
Duty free, duty free, duty free One Bloody Mary, please I spend the hours dancing
And he, desperate in the bar, drinking and drinking
His look at me is a killer, I have him worked up
He’s dying inside himself and I’m crazy I may be from an underground slum
But my heart has declared to you
Duty free, duty free, duty free One Bloody Mary, please There could have been a good tease
It looked pluperfect
But see, your time is over
The night starts again The moon changed direction, and I saw myself staggering
Frantically looking for ambiance
And see, what’s the point of this?
Again you and me, face to face I may be from an underground slum
But my heart has declared to you
Duty free, duty free, duty free One Bloody Mary, please There could have been a good tease
It looked pluperfect
But see, your time is over
The night starts again There could have been a good tease
It looked pluperfect
But see, your time is over
The night starts again One Bloody Mary, please"
I Do,"'Cause I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I love you like a fool
(Love you like a fool)
I've been there by your side
We've been laughing, we have cried
Kept the piece of heart you gave
From our breakup day
You left me, still, I know
You didn't have a choice
Waiting for the day we're back together
I won't give you up, I'll never stop
I got a piece of your heart, I can't get enough
'Cause I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I love you like a fool
(Love you like a fool)
Our lives were torn apart
I know we'll get a brand new start
When the world just can't decide
Where we lay our love
We've done our time alone
And never will again
Waiting for the day we're back together
I won't give you up, I'll never stop
I got a piece of your heart, I can't get enough
'Cause I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I need you
I won't give you up, I'll never stop
I got a piece of your heart, I can't get enough
'Cause I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I love you like a fool
(Love you like a fool)
Waiting for the day when I hear you say
Our love is here to stay
I won't give you up, I'll never stop (Never stop)
I got a piece of your heart, I can't get enough
'Cause I do, I do, I do (Oh yes, I do)
I do, I do, I need you
I won't give you up, I'll never stop
I got a piece of your heart, I can't get enough
'Cause I do, I do, I do (Yes, I do)
I do, I do, I do (Yes, I do)
I do, I do, I love you like a fool

No No Never,"[Verse 1]
My love is stronger now than you'll ever know
And it won't ever let you go
My love is wider than the ocean can be
And it's deeper than the deep blue sea
My love goes higher than a mountain can rise
And I see it there, in your eyes
My love gets tougher when the going gets rough
And believe me, I got more than enough

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep tryin', babe, keep holdin' on
There's a place we belong
Where things are good, where love is strong

[Chorus]
I'm never ever gonna leave you to cry on your own
Never ever gonna not go and pick up the phone
I'm never ever gonna let you be chilled to the bone
No, no, never
No, no, never

I'm never ever gonna leave when you're lost in the storm
Never ever gonna not keep you safe where it's warm
I never ever will desert you when your heart is torn
No, no, never

My love shines brighter than a twinklin' star
Baby, no matter where you are
And my love keeps burnin' like an eternal flame
You can feel it when I'm callin' your name

Twist of Love,"Once upon a time there was this guy called Johnny
He was kinda shy and so in love with Connie
But so was O'Smarty, who played it cool
The king of the party, but oh... what a fool
(What a fool)

He didn't know how to twist
He didn't know how to make a girl insist
He didn't know how to move, he didn't feel the groove
He didn't know how to twist

Twist, he didn't know how to twist
He didn't know how to move, he didn't feel the groove
He didn't know how to twist

Once upon a night there was this guy called Johnny
He was kinda high and dancing with his honey
The queen of the party proclaimed him king
While poor ol' O'Smarty was left in the ring

He didn't know how to twist
He didn't know how to make a girl insist
He didn't know how to move, he didn't feel the groove
He didn't know how to twist

Twist, he didn't know how to twist
He didn't know how to move, he didn't feel the groove
He didn't know how to twist
Hit it, Johnny

A twist of love, a twist of pain
A twist of me and you
A twist of things you can't explain
Will make your dream come true

Be sure you know how to twist
Be sure you know how to make a girl insist
Be sure you know how to move, be sure you feel the groove
Be sure you know how to twist

Oh... (Twist)
Yeah, twist
Be sure you know how to move, be sure you feel the groove
Be sure you know how to twist

Be sure you know how to move, be sure you feel the groove
Be sure you know how to twist"

Teenage Life,"Now hear this

""What did you learn at school today?""
That's what the teachers used to say
But they don't know
Don't understand, do they?
Why do they always give advice
Saying ""Just be nice, always think twice""
When it's been a long time since they had a teenage life

""What did you learn at school today?""
That's what the teachers used to say
But they don't know
Don't understand, do they?
Why do they always give advice
Saying ""Just be nice, always think twice""
When it's been a long time since they had a teenage life

Dwelling on the past, from back when I was young
Thinking of my school days and trying to write this song
Classroom schemes and dreams
Man they couldn't save me
Cos my days were numbered when I signed down on Avy
Teenage kicks running out what could we do
I still show respect to my boys who made it through
And getting told off Mr T how my life would be
Then giving him a signal
So everyone could see
Sunshine and shade
Those girls I'd serenade
Thinking of those sixth form chicks that misbehave
Hoping that those days would go on and on forever
Every day something new
Just friends running together
But suddenly school ends
Your teenage life's gone
All your mates are growing up now
They're moving on
And now I'm looking back
I'll tell you what I know
Do you listen to your teacher?
No I don't think so

""What did you learn at school today?""
That's what the teachers used to say
But they don't know
Don't understand
Do they?
Why do they always give advice
Saying ""Just be nice, always think twice""
When it's been a long since they had a teenage life

Now if you treat the kids fine, together they will shine
Ooh ooh ooh shine
And if you give the kids time, they won't do the crime
Won't do the crime

Now my bad old ways
Were during my school days
Messing on those grade A's
My life is just a haze
I'm going through the struggle
Five ten and kicking back
So I could lock my flow
Lace it up now on the track
Oh yeh I felt the pain
Whilst chasing all the fame
I'm being told I'm nothing
Just a player in the game
But now I walk tall
Stand proud for you to see
I'm driving these fast cars
It's five stars for me

""What did you learn at school today?""
That's what the teachers used to say
But they don't know
Don't understand, do they?
Why do they always give advice
Saying ""Just be nice, always think twice""
When it's been a long since they had a teenage life"
Everything,"[Verse 1]
I can hear my heart breaking
As I open the door
I can feel the tears
On my face burn like fire
As I look in your eyes
And I know
I'm still in love with...

[Chorus]
I'm still in love with...
Everything I hate
Everything you do
Everything I fear
Everything on you
Baby, baby, I'm still in love with...
Everything I hate
Everything you do
Everything I fear
Everything on you
Everything I hate
Everything you do
Everything I fear
Everything on you

[Verse 2]
I can feel my life ending
As a whisper goodbye
And I know

[Chorus]
I'm still in love with…
Everything I hate
Everything you do
Everything I fear
Everything on you
With everything I hate
Everything you do
Everything I fear
Everything on you

[Bridge]
I can't believe I still need you
I can't believe I still want you
I can't believe life means
Nothing without you
Baby, I'm still in love
Still in love, still in love

[Chorus]
With everything I hate
Everything you do
Everything I fear
Everything on you
Everything I hate
Everything you do
Everything I fear
Everything on you
I'm in love with everything you are"
Il était temps,"Coming to be, as the only reason to withstand
Hanging on, raising one's voice to be alive
It's said, it's sung easily
But my chorus today is: It was time
For heaven to finally remember me
It was time
Finally a respite, my very own chance
It was time, it was time Running after one's ideal, it's worth the trouble
Suffering, it hurts less if there's a dream at the end
It's said, it's sung easily
But my chorus today is: It was time
For heaven to finally remember me
It was time
Finally a respite, my very own chance
It was time, it was time I didn't believe in it anymore, I didn't believe in it anymore
Incidentally, it's still hard for me to believe it It was time
For heaven to finally remember me
It was time
Finally a respite, my very own chance It was time
Provided that it'll last, and if it doesn't last
I will be happy to tell my children
That I struck it once in my lifetime It was time"

Push the Button,"The world is full of terror

מסרים מתפוצצים עליי
טילים מתעופפים וגם נופלים עליי
שוטרים וגנבים מתרוצצים עליי
והם קופצים עליי, מתקרצצים עליי

אללי אללי תענה לי אלוהי הי
הסיוט הזה ארוך מדי
כשאני בקושי חי וכולם מכוונים אלי
זה מוקדם לשיר אולי
שנתתי לך חיי

ווי ווי - המשטרה
וויאוו וויאוו - צוות הצלה
הנה זה בקדם שיר ללא סלאם
אדום זה לא רק צבע זה יותר כמו דם
שוב עוצר בלב את הנשימה
שלא תפרח עכשיו הנשמה
הנה מלחמה הנה הנשמה

בום בום זה מה שקורה עכשיו
בין רקטה למצ'טה בין צופה לכתב
בין מחטף לנחטף בין גשום לשרב
הסלמה במדרגות עולה ותופסת קו

כלום כלום זה מה שכולם עושים
קיצונים מקצינים וקצינים מרצינים
התמימים מתמתנים ממתינים לנתונים
ועונים: שכולם חסרי אונים

עולם כולו דמונים שאנחנו סתם פיונים
ושמפיונים עם ז'יטונים מחליטים מה שיהיה
ניהול בעצלתיים, אוניה מלאה במים
וכולם שותים לחיים וטובעים זה לצד זה

אולי זה חד מדי, צריך לשיר שירי דקלים
שירי מדבר ללא דגלים
אני עוד חי חי חי, ואם ימשיך להיות מפחיד
רק אז אני אגיד

I'm gonna push the button, push the button
Push the bu... push the bu... push the button
Push the button, push the button
Push the bu... push the bu... push the button"
"Comme ci, comme ça","Every Monday, you finish your work too late
And then TV and sleep, when my heart wakes up
And every Tuesday, you tell me in the morning – and you forget it
""We'll go to the cinema"", and in the evening – ""sorry"" Like this, like that, life passes by
And the good times pass us over
Like this, like that, love breaks
Routine and laziness threaten us Like this, like that, I can't take it anymore
I'm disappointed, you've lost me
I'm not sticking around anymore, like this, like that
That's the end, like this, like that Even on Saturday at midnight, you have already told me ""good night""
You fall asleep just as I go out, singing to yourself very loudly"

Valentine Lost,"I'll let the music play while love lies softly bleeding
In heavy hands - on shadow lands
As thunder clouds roll in sunset is receding
No summerwine - no Valentine

A tiger trapped inside a cage
An actor on an empty stage
Come see the show
Rock and roll can heal your soul
When broken hearts lose all control

Some rivers still run dry and jungles burn to embers
Gold autumn days - must fade to gray
There is a reason why a haunted man remembers
One frozen night - his darkest day

A tiger trapped inside a cage
An actor on an empty stage
Come see the show
Rock and roll can heal your soul
When broken hearts lose all control

A passion killed by acid rain
A rollercoaster in my brain
But how would you know
In your satin silk and lace
Another time another place

A tiger trapped inside a cage
An actor on an empty stage
Come see the show
Rock and roll can heal your soul
When broken hearts lose all control

A love that loose and painted black
A train stuck on a broken track
I'll let it go
Rock and roll has healed my soul
The stage is set on with the show"
Visionary Dream,"I'll dream up tales and rhymes
In visionary dream
This precious moment of my life
Holds me excited

I will fly away
To reach the heights I've ever dreamed
Beneath the sun
No sense of time and space

And dissipation of your light
Holds me excited

Clouds containing lakes
And in the haze of morning light
I feel embraced

Sailing through my story
Sharing my history
Sailing through my story
Sharing my history

Ah... ah ah...

Sailing through my story
Sharing my history
Sailing through my story
Sharing my history

The precious moment of my life
Holds me excited
The meditation of my dreams
Holds me delighted

I will fly away
To reach the ambience I've dreamed
Beneath the sun

Sailing through my story
Sharing my history
Sailing through my story
Sharing my history"

Fight,"Never, never, never, never

Obsession, we hide in the back
And devotion's finding a way
When highness exists for those people who pray

Every day is like a start
Ups and downs, tears and laugh
We never stop, just fight

Never let nobody in
And step right on your dream
If you really wanna take this trip
Fighting anywhere we go
To face this cruel world
We gotta just fight forever

Believing, forfeiting the past
The onfall's adapting the hearts
Each people will gnaw our wishes, no more

Every day is like a start
Ups and downs, tears and laugh
We never stop, just fight

Never let nobody in
And step right on your dream

Could this be our second chance?
The one that's gonna last?

Need you more every day

Hear My Plea (Balada e gurit),"I say farewell, the final call
I turn and walk away, I leave it all
I find that life regains its glow
But the journey's long, the going's slow

A million miles later
I crave a love that's greater
Take me home again, ha...

Hear my plea
Take the longing of my heartbeat
Make the melody

Hear my plea
As it quivers in the tear drops
That you shed for me

I beg you, hear my plea
Take the longing of my heartbeat
For eternity

Hear my plea
Take the longing of my heartbeat
Make the melody

Hear my plea
As it quivers in the tear drops
That you shed for me

I beg you, hear my plea
Take the longing of my heartbeat
For eternity

I beg you, hear my plea
The pain, the suffering of today
Tomorrow's memory"

Life melts like ice
Disappears in the twinkling of an eye I'm losing my mind,
Pushing reality out of sight
Our lips are touching softly
You're the one I believe blindly I walk around like crazy
Falling in love frightens me
Days are like wounds
Countless and hard to get through Prayer.It burns my sore lips like a fire
Prayer.Thy name is something I admire
Heaven knows just as well as I do
So many times I have cried over you
Heaven knows just as well as I do
I pray and live only for you I can't lie to God
As I kneel down and pray
You're the love of my life
That's the only thing I can say"
Malá dáma,"She picked a grass blade and started playing
the little lady from the suburbs
who tells fortunes by reading palms
there ravenous cats wander at dawn
after nights full of vice
she caresses them and feeds them
at night she roams and sleeps by day
and her eyes have seen more than mine
I ran out of words, just standing there
this one girl I would die for This one girl I would die for in a single day
and if you think that's not enough
among hundred women standing there
I'd ask her to dance though I never dance Her den is there by the railway
she collects coins from fountains
then lines them up on a track
she builds her sanctuary, metal plates bridge
now being crossed by her first guest
let him rest
she has gone through hell yet knows wonders
she counts the flattened coins
and each who meets her falls for her
this one girl I would die for This one girl I would die for in a single day
and if you think that's not enough
among hundred women standing there
I'd ask her to dance though I never dance I will never forget that minute
her music reminded me of Paganini
that moment I knew to be cursed
asked her price with feeling of guilt This one girl I would die for in a single day
and if you think that's not enough
among hundred women standing there
I'd ask her to dance though I never dance This one girl I would die for in a single day

Gave you all, A to Z

Lovin' you gives me vertigo

Am I crazy? Could it be maybe
Solo is the way to go?

Salvem el món (Let's Save the World),"It seems hard to believe
That all we see is all we need
In our world we live today
Still tomorrow’s far away We only think about living well
Our eyes are blind to the future hell
Our world’s at risk, but we don’t care
To what we do, we’re unaware We all agree we’re not awake
Instead of acting we all sit and wait
Let’s stop committing more mistakes
More mistakes
(One, two, one, two, one, two, three, four) Left, right, up and down, turned upside down
That’s how we treat the world right now
Can’t hide the fact that it’s happening We can do our world some good
We can make a change, that’s what we should
Time will tell us, but we must act now The problem seems to be
That people need to see to believe
The only way to fix this now
Is to act and (not sit down) We all agree we’re not awake
Instead of acting, we all sit and wait

We still can act, but we don’t react
‘Cause we only care about what we have
About what we have

Unsubstantial Blues,"[Verse 1]
How many times have you fooled me and denied that?
It's her whom you love and it sure isn't me?
So now that it's over, I'll try and take it sober
Leave questions unasked
Remember us laughing at the broken past
God, if I could make it on without you

[Chorus]
You're such a casual man, oh, wavin' an empty hand
I'm helpless and I'm lonely without you
Yes, you're a casual man lendin' an empty hand
Left me breathless with nothing more to lose

[Verse 2]
I used to dream we'd take it nice and easy
Get jobs, settle down in Jameson Town
If now you could see me, you'd think twice about leavin'
Y' said forever is the time you're gonna spend around

So why did you leave me?
And why should I believe it?
You say goodbye
Oh, why, oh... why you leave me?
Said, why?

[Chorus]
You're such a casual man, oh, wavin' an empty hand
I'm helpless and I'm lonely without you
You're such a casual man lendin' an empty hand
Left me breathless with nothing more to lose
Casual man lendin' an empty hand
Left me breathless with nothing more to lose
Except an evanescent unsubstantial blues"
Partners in Crime,"We're standing in the rain
And sipping cold champagne
The night is full of angels of sin
The demons of pleasure and pain

You whisper in my ear
I'm holding back the tears
Your words are burning the way to my heart
That's been held hostage for years

The wild look in your eyes
Will light my fire inside
This is the night that we cannot deny
We'll always be partners in crime

I kiss your lips so sweet
Mmm... but do you feel the heat?
Is it so wrong to be hungry for love?
To follow the passion so deep?

The wild look in your eyes
Will light my fire inside
This is the night that we cannot deny
We'll always be partners in crime

The wild look in your eyes
Will light my fire inside
This is the night that we cannot deny
We'll always be partners in crime

Now it's too late to turn back the time
We just have to go with the flow
I will be yours and you will be mine
And that's how the story goes

The wild look in your eyes
Will light my fire inside
This is the night that we cannot deny
We'll always be partners in crime

The wild look in your eyes
Will light my fire inside
This is the night that we cannot deny
We'll always be partners in crime

Partners in crime
Partners in crime"
LovePower,"Can you feel the love power?
Can you feel the love?

I wake up every morning
Another day on my own
I'm in the eye of the storm
And I feel so alone

But when I notice the sunshine (Sunshine)
The summer breeze in the air
And when I dream of your sweet smile
Why should I fall into despair?

Can you feel the love power coming your way?
Can you feel the love power all day?
Can you feel the love power coming your way?
(Can you feel the love power?)

Today is another bad day
I'm gonna turn into stone
There's too much pressure on me
And I feel so alone

I feel the temperature rising (Rising)
There's something new in the air
And all the birds are just singing low
Why should I fall into despair?

Can you feel the love power coming your way?
Can you feel the love power all day?
Can you feel the love power coming your way?
(Can you feel the love power?)

(Can't you feel the love power?)
(Can't you feel the love power?)
(Can't you feel the love power?)
Can you feel the love?

(Can you feel the love power coming your way?)
(Can you feel the love power?)

Can you feel the love power coming your way?
Can you feel the love power all day?
Can you feel the love power coming your way?
Can you feel the love power?

Can you feel the love power coming your way?
Can't you feel the love power?

Can you feel the love power?"

Shake It Up Şekerim,"She smiled at me, said: ""Would you like it sweet and low?""
""I know a place where we can take it nice and slow""

Get a Life – Get Alive,"Livin' in this world - be a little too much
Don't let it get you down, get up and strut
Ooh...
If you ever get the chance, hold your hand out and take it
Make a promise to yourself, don't you break it

Oh, I tried to get up when I was upside down
Got to find a way to turn my life around

This is the time for us to get a life
Open your mind to a better life

Get a life, a better life

Go outta your way and make some compromise
Hold to your dreams and you will realise
If you don't understand it, don't take it for granted
Open your mind to a better life

Let's turn up the heat, start a ripple in the water
Wake the soul from its sleep, no particular order
Could be wastin' precious time, free the mind, are you willin'?
Don't be afraid, do your dance and start livin'

I've got a vision in mind, I'm doin' my time
I'm livin' my life 'cause I've opened my mind

Questa notte,"Your smile of a little girl is what enchants me
And shakes my heart
The sea in your big green eyes is what calls me
And makes me feel love
When it seems dark, you make me see the sun
I want to stay here with you
Live for you, just for you This night will be immensity
The love between us will never end
Now and in the future, more and more
This night will forever be The scent of your skin encourages me
To discover what I don't know
Through all the stars, you make me see the moon
And you make me sing love When I lose every hope, you take my hand
I want to stay here with you
Live for you, just for you This night will be immensity
The love between us will never end
Now and in the future, more and more
For the reason you only now
You only know This night will be immensity
The love between us will never end
Now and in the future, more and more
This night will forever be
This night will forever be"
Rijeka bez imena (Ријека без имена),"Down the nameless river, like a wave
my sorrow will flow
to find you, rose of all winds
Only I know the paths across the water Day by day and night by night
I’m building my pain
like a bridge across a river that flows to you
Who else loves you like I do
who can touch your soul just like me Sorrow, infidelity my trouble
how can I get you back
to hug you as if it’s the first time
to spread gold over the rivers of your tears Sorrow, infidelity, if only I could
I’d still go anywhere with you
Let the pain be mine
because I’m dying for you"

They Can't Stop the Spring,"The curtain has been raised
The wall no longer stands
And from Lisadell to Latvia
We're singing as one clan

The curtain has been raised
And Europe's all one stage
And the archipelagic icicles
Have melted like the cage

We don't need no party
Just a party band
A continental choir
Singing hand in hand

They might scare the blackbird
But they cannot stop him sing
They may steal the honey
But they'll never steal the sting
They may crush the flowers
Trample every living thing
But they can't stop the spring

They might scare the blackbird
But they cannot stop him sing
They may steal the honey
But they'll never steal the sting
They may crush the flowers
Trample every living thing
But they can't stop the spring

They might scare the blackbird
But they cannot stop him sing
They may steal the honey
But they'll never steal the sting
They may crush the flowers
Trample every living thing
But they can't stop the spring"
Leave Me Alone,"I have to leave, but you are still sleeping
There's nothing to say, our time has run out
You took me to bed, that's what you were seeking
But you don't even care what I am about

I wanna, I wanna wake you

Leave me alone, I wanna go home
I don't wanna see you, so leave me alone
Leave me alone, 'cause I feel like dyin'
Leave me alone, I wanna go home
The day will still come when I see you crying
'Cause you will get yours, just leave me alone

But what if I stay and wait till she comes home?
She don't even know she loves you in vain
The lies that you told will turn into sorrow
I gotta go crazy just to stay sane

I wanna, I wanna break you

Leave me alone, I wanna go home
I don't wanna see you, so leave me alone
Leave me alone, 'cause I feel like dyin'
Leave me alone, I wanna go home
The day will still come when I see you crying
'Cause you will get yours, just leave me alone

I gotta, I gotta hate you

Leave me alone, I wanna go home
I don't wanna see you, so leave me alone
Leave me alone, 'cause I feel like dyin'
Leave me alone, I wanna go home
I couldn't care less if love just lies dying
And this is goodbye, just leave me alone"
Love or Leave,"Stars in the sky
When the shadows fall, when the sunlight dies
Empty streets are filled, with the pale lamplight
We are just two lonely shades, walking in the night

Words lose their sense
When I feel you near, when I touch your hands
I'm trying not to think that at break of dawn
You'll be gone and I'll be lost, numb and all alone

When the morning comes, I'm all alone
Left to live another day, in joy or sadness on my own
When the morning comes, I'm all alone
Every time at break of dawn

Weak and unwise
I betray all fears that I should disguise
Melting in your arms, I fail to realise
Why the mornings always change the colour of your eyes

When the morning comes, I'm all alone
Every time at break of dawn

Love or leave, I'm with and without you
How come I am up to this senseless game?
How could I stop thinking about you?
Love or leave, don't play with my heart again

Love or leave, I'm with and without you
How come I am up to this senseless game?
How could I stop thinking about you?
Hey yeah... love or leave, don't play with my heart again"
Yassou Maria (Γειά σου Μαρία),"[Verse 1]
First off she's a lady
And this is a ladies' world
Man, she drives them crazy
Dancing like a cheeky girl
All eyes on Maria
No lies, she's the bomb
Oh my, they all wanna see her
All wanna be the lucky one

[Chorus]
Shake it up, shake it up, there you go
Oh oh, yassou Maria
Turn around, bring it down, go slow
Heads up, Lord, have mercy
Shake it up, shake it up, there you go
Oh oh, yassou Maria
Ay ay ay, there she goes... Maria
Yassou Maria

[Verse 2]
Moves like Aphrodite
So high above the rest
Smooth like Cleopatra
An angel in a devil's dress
Her hips, lust in motion
Her lips, red like wine
She is the heart of attention
Probably should mention
She's mine...

[Chorus]
Shake it up, shake it up, there you go
Oh oh, yassou Maria
Turn around, bring it down, go slow
Heads up, Lord, have mercy
Shake it up, shake it up, there you go
Oh oh, yassou Maria
Ay ay ay, there she goes... Maria

[Chorus]
Shake it up, shake it up, there you go
Oh oh, yassou Maria
Turn around, bring it down, go slow
Heads up, Lord, have mercy
Shake it up, shake it up, there you go
Oh oh, yassou Maria
Ay ay ay, there she goes... Maria

The Worrying Kind,"Moves, I like to make 'em
Grooves, I like to shake 'em
Shake 'em from my troublesome mind
'Cause sometimes you'll find
That I'm out of my mind
You see baby, I'm the worrying kind

Words, I'd like to break 'em
Words, I like to shake 'em
Shake 'em from my troublesome mind
And you turn up your nose
It's a joke you suppose
But baby, I'm the worrying kind

So if you see me somewhere
With that glassy ol' stare
And the panic and fear in my eyes
Don't call for first aid or the fire brigade
Or the local police 'cause they won't care
I'm just a silly old boy with my head in the can
Just a mortal with potential of a superman
But what sense does it make
When I feel like a fake
When I'm saying to you all be good for goodness sake?

Words, I like to break 'em
Words, I'd like to shake 'em
Shake 'em from my troublesome mind
And why? Heaven knows
It's a joke I suppose
But baby, I'm the worrying kind

So if you see me somewhere
With that glassy ol' stare
And the panic and fear in my eyes
Don't call for first aid or the fire brigade
Or the local police 'cause they won't care
I'm just a silly old boy with my head in the can
Just a mortal with potential of a superman
But what sense does it make
When I feel like a fake
When I'm saying to you all be good for goodness sake?

Oh, words, I like to shake 'em
Words, I'd like to break 'em
Shake 'em from my troublesome mind
And why? Heaven knows
It's a joke I suppose
But baby, I'm the worrying kind

And you turn up your nose
And you say it's a pose
But baby, I'm the worrying kind

Yeah, sometimes I'm blind
I'm just out of my mind
Baby, I'm the worrying kind"
L'amour à la française,"I remember the beautiful girl,
The last summer, us and the Eiffel Tour,
I remember how beautiful you were,
So beautiful with your Chanel purse,
On the bridges of Seine,
Let's do it again, again, again, again
You gave me a rendezvous,
What is it? What is it? I'm looking for you in the streets,
but I didn't come back because you weren't there anymore,
I'm looking everywhere, where are you?
My heart is bleeding, oh, I miss you
Love, the French way
Let's do it again, again, again, again,

I've lost the love, the love, the love,
I'm lost, here with out you
And I'm crazy, by myself in Paris,
I miss you, without you, I can't
And under the rain, I feel sorry,
Champs-Élysées, alone at night,
The Moulin Rouge, I feel guilty And the sun more bright than the birds,
And in the sky, I miss you so.
A memory, a randezvous, some flowers,
Some flowers, some flowers, for you
I miss you, without you, I can't,
And under the rain, I feel sorry.
I am lost here without you,
And I'm crazy, by myself in Paris. I remember the beautiful girl,
The last summer, how beautiful you were
I remember us and the Eiffel Tower,
So beautiful with your Chanel purse,
Love, the French way, just because I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you,
I give you a rendezvous And I run, I run, I run
I've lost the love, the love, the love
I'm lost, here without you
And I'm crazy, by myself in Paris,
I miss you, without you, I can't,
And under the rain, I feel sorry.
Champs-Élysées, alone, at night,
The Moulin Rouge, I feel guilty
And the sun is brighter than the birds,
And in the sky, I miss you so.
A memory, a rendezvous, some flowers
Some flowers, some flowers, for you
I miss you, without you, I can't.
And under the rain, I feel sorry,
I am lost here without you"

Frauen regier'n die Welt,"Even back at school, the boys all laughed
But I really didn't care
She was so cute, her legs were so long
I went to her ballet class for almost a year When I found out she was into the environment
I stitched ''No, thanks'' onto my parka
She didn't care about that back then
But since then I know who rules the world The way the walk and stand
The way they look at you
And your wallet and heart start to open up
And you buy a ring and a mink coat One seductive glance
And your political views start to change
It's not the boss or the action heroes
It's not the state or the mafia money
Women rule the world All the stops, from coquettish to naive
Even as babies, they had a hold on their fathers
They give everything when there's something they want
And you bang your head against a brick wall when they're sulking You make a fool of yourself
And let yourself get beaten up
Just so the girls would look over just once
They can push Beckham
And overthrow Clinton
Without even having to form a party The way the walk and stand
The way they look at you
And your wallet and heart start to open up
And you buy a ring and a mink coat One seductive glance
And your political views start to change
It's not the boss or the action heroes
It's not the state or the mafia money
Women rule the world The way the walk and stand
The way they look at you
And your wallet and heart start to open up
And you buy a ring and a mink coat One seductive glance
And your political views start to change
It's not the boss or the action heroes
It's not the state or the mafia money
Women rule the world"

Anytime You Need,"Why, baby tell me why
Does someone always say goodbye?
You should never doubt, all I'll ever do
Is watch over you

I only wanna guard
Every beat of your gentle heart
Look and you will see
You can count on me, depend on me

Anytime you need
Any place you say
Anything indeed
Anyhow, any way

I wanna be your friend
Day by day to the very end
If you ever call crying with the blues
I'm here for you

Anytime you need
Any place you say
Anything indeed
Anyhow, any way

I'll dry your tears when you cry
And I need no reason why

Zauvijek volim te (Заувијек волим те),"Like night pulsates around the city
I don’t know where you are
Heart is bursting with love
in empty bed
Sorrow is writing songs
while tears are falling
my pillow smells like you
and you are long gone Don’t let me go crazy
Everything is so sad
Be mine again
I love you forever Don’t let me go crazy
I can’t make it on my own anymore
God and people forgive
I belong to you Like night pulsates around the city
I don’t know where you are
You’re standing on the edge of the heart

to follow your steps
I’m wasting time in vain

The Fire in Your Eyes (Ke'ilu kan) (כאילו כאן),"My soul is hoping for the warm heart’s prayers It is hard, it is hard when you’re longing for the moonlight,
It is here for a moment and then breaks away,  tears follow
It is hard, it is hard when you’re longing for the moonlight,
It is here for a moment and then breaks away,  tears follow
Sometimes the wind brings a nice, familiar smell
It caresses, listens
To you singing Not a light star
You are now
With me, with me, as if it was real
Like back then Come along, come along
See the fire in your eyes
And you come with me, with me
Sometimes the wind brings a nice, familiar smell
It caresses, listens Not a starlight
You are now
With me, with me, as if it was real
Like back then My soul is hoping for the warm heart’s prayers
My soul is hoping for the warm heart’s prayers
Not a light star
With me, with me, as if it was real

A Century of Love,"The rain has touched my steps
The rain touched my smile
I'm going to its depth
It takes me to the sky

All the stars are falling down and now
I can reach the rainbow
Hold my hand and come with me
To my other way of being

This is all I need:
Be my ""everything""
And remember
Our dreams together...

This is all I mean:
Be my ""everything""
And live forever
Ever, ever

All I need
Is to find a little place to live
In your heart
That's what I want
And to find the words to say
To find the words I've never said
The words I need to touch your world
And your life
To breathe your soul

A century is now
Not enough
For my love"
Complice,"I never would have thought of you as my accomplice
capable of understanding my every joy or sorrow The peace of a moment
Is all that we are
Is all that I feel And I see you as the immensity
Like a tear on a white page
Between sex and music, I thought of you
That you are so much more, something that isn’t there And feeling you as a part of me
Is like having an angel
Sustain my every insecure step As always it rains
When we find ourselves
Suspended in the silence of a kiss And I see you as the immensity
Like a tear on a white page
Between sex and music, I thought of you
That you are so much more, something that isn’t there And I see you as the immensity
Like a tear on a white page
Between sex and music, I thought of you
That you are so much more, something that isn’t there"
O Julissi,
Day After Day,"For peace we pray
Save us from all fears
Oh Lord, save us...

You can feel me in your mind
With every breath you take
Burn the earth with flame of sins
I'll make you feel dismay

Our feelings play with us
But you must keep yourself under control
If you're searching for resolves
Be ready for the tolls

Show us the right way
Day after day
All fears we must forget
Then better world we'll get

If you have the greatest aim
Keep it in your soul
I'll be always by your side
Always in your heart

Our dreams can play with us
Even if we think that we keep control
From all horrors of the world
Salvation is love, love

The earth is in flame
And you must share the blame
Look inside yourself
We both are there

Day after day
Day after day
Day...

Day after day
All fears we must forget
Then better world we'll get
Then better world we'll get
Then better world we'll get
Then better world we'll get"
Vrag naj vzame,"On the floor by myself, the last tear for you in my eyes
I wipe the traces left by defeat
You without words, in a moment destroyed my world
Now I’m gathering all the shadows of love to throw them in your face
To hell with everything that’s between us
I’m throwing your pictures on the floor
To hell with it, I’m moving forward on my own
Tearing apart all the memories so it’ll be over soon I’m not letting you look me in the eyes ever again
Now there’s nothing in me for you
You’re a stranger to me, whom I don’t recognize in the street
When I see you I pass by you, turning my head the other way To hell with everything that’s between us
I’m throwing your pictures on the floor
To hell with it, I’m moving forward on my own
Tearing apart all the memories so it’ll be over soon To hell with everything that’s between us
I know that tears for you are a waste
Now there’s only drama between us
Which won’t return my stolen dreams
(My stolen dreams) Dreams You broke me, I admit
But I’m moving on
By myself into every new day
I’m stronger than ever before To hell with everything that’s between us
I’m throwing your pictures on the floor
To hell with it, I’m moving forward on my own
Tearing apart all the memories so it’ll be over soon To hell with everything that’s between us
I know that tears for you are a waste
Now there’s only drama between us
Which won’t return my stolen dreams"
Hold on Be Strong,"Love can be hard sometimes
Yes, it can catch you off guard like bad crimes
Yes, it can make you depressed and angry
Make you say: ""why me, why won't anybody try me?""

You might be saying: ""ooh, I don't wanna be lonely""
""Ooh, I don't wanna be by myself""
""Ooh, don't wanna be lonely""
""Why ain't anybody lovin' me?""

But there's always someone out there who'll be there for you
There is always someone out there who'll care for you
There's always someone out there who'll be true, true, true
Hold on, hold on, be strong

Love can go away forever if you push it
And you have to remember: don't rush it
If it ain't right, it is wrong
And you'll be crying: ""why me, why won't anybody try me?""

You might be saying: ""ooh, I don't wanna be lonely""
""Ooh, I don't wanna be by myself""
""Ooh, don't wanna be lonely, oh no no""
""Why ain't anybody lovin' me?""

Now, but there's always someone out there who'll be there for you
And there's always someone out there who'll care for you
There's always someone out there who'll be true, true, true
Hold on, hold on, be strong

And yes, there's always someone out there who'll be there for you
And there's always someone out there who'll care for you
There's always someone out there who'll be true, true, true
Hold on, hold on, be strong

Hold on, hold on, be strong
My child, hold on, hold on, be strong"
For Life,"I had no choice
Perfectly clear from the start
I heard your voice
And I was falling
Into a space
Where daylight kisses moonlit skies

It was the place
As written in your eyes
And oh, we made it
We finally found our way
And celebrating
Just where we...We stand today

I'll let my heart show the way
Oceans and mountians between us
Because your love Is why
You made the wrong right
I will give my all
Will heed your call
For Life

I had no choice
Perfectly clear from the start
I will rejoice
Embrace your calling
And into a space
Where daylight kisses moonlit skies

I heard your voice
And I knew it was for life

I'll let my heart show the way
Oceans and mountians between us
Because your love Is why
Ou made the wrong right
I will give my all
Will heed your call
For Life
For Life"

Casanova,"[Intro]
(Oh, Casanova, -nova, -nova)

[Verse 1]
A thousand stars were shining their light in the night skies
You and me, a magical moment in your eyes (Casanova)
Lost in love, I waited a lifetime to find you
The stars above were burning so bright to remind you (Casanova)

[Pre-Chorus]
Boom, boom, boom, my heart still goes crazy
When I think of you

[Chorus]
Oh, Casanova
I feel love would last forever
Let me always stay together
Can you feel it in your heart?

Oh, Casanova
In a fairy tale I found you
I'm alive when I'm around you
I can't live if we're apart

[Verse 2]
I sing a song and bring back the past to remind me
Now you're gone, no longer good times behind me (Casanova)

[Pre-Chorus]
Boom, boom, boom, my heart still goes crazy
When I think of you

[Chorus]
Oh, Casanova
I feel love would last forever
Let me always stay together
Can you feel it in your heart?

Oh, Casanova
In a fairy tale I found you
I'm alive when I'm around you
I can't live if we're apart

Vull escoltar que tu m'estimes

Don't clap with your wooden slippers, don't pretend that you are lady

Don't come from the castle untill your love is strong enough On my favourite tactic (something like tactic)
to cheat fauna (animal world) and flora (plant world)
that life didn't come from the sea
but from love
Love, love
from love So many days we have spent
laying around, eating bananas
so we fell on lower branches
without love
love, love
without love I'll try to kiss you

Your Heart Belongs to Me,"There was a time when I was in love with a fool
He stepped on my heart, bruised me, and broke the golden rule
There was a time I couldn’t tell weak from strong
A voice in my head kept saying this can’t go on
Even though I longed, something’s wrong

You know your heart belongs to me
You made it clear to see
That we were never meant to be
Only a memory remains

Oh yes your heart belongs to me
But I’ve got to set you free
Cause we were never meant to be together

I’ve learned my lesson, now I know where I stand
Time heals all wounds and broken hearts will mend
I’ve read all the signs and now I’ve moved along
This carousel keeps turning on and on, and on and on
Life goes on

You know your heart belongs to me
You made it clear to see
That we were never meant to be
Only a memory remains

Oh yes your heart belongs to me
But I’ve got to set you free
Cause we were never meant to be together

I wish I was the wind, the sun the rain
And I could hold time in my hands
In my dreams I’ll fly high so I can reach the stars
I sit on top of a mountain and scream
When nobody hears me
Nobody sees me

You know your heart belongs to me
You made it clear to see
That we were never meant to be
Only a memory remains
Oh yes your heart belongs to me
But I’ve got to set you free
Cause we were never meant to be together
You know your heart belongs to me"

Not cowards at all Chorus:
Where men ride
There no sheep can herd
Where men ride
There you can hear the wolves howling There may be destruction ahead

Pe-o margine de lume,"Sworn, we smoke one and, we clean the floor of the station but, burnt, the coppers check identities for crying out loud I do the rounds and I laugh thinking about that old Ronsard and our teeth are tanned in ash.
I hiccup and I laugh thinking about that idiot Icarus and our burnt wings. Prisoners, hand cuffs
are not beautiful, dream and glory.
But didn't I see those bulletproof vans arrive, flashing lights. I do the rounds and I laugh thinking about that old Ronsard and our teeth are tanned together.
I hiccup and I laugh for a while and for good we will have escaped,
and they will never be able to find us again. Our two sparrowhawks, in full flight of summer were plucked, what a nightmare.
Further away I used to see, falling tears, on your cheeks enlightened by the headlights.
Trapped, hang yourself doll, pass me the lighter and never again will they be able to find us. I smoke, I finish by believing that like this black cigarette I harm you my beauty.
Our grey lungs, our black lungs, what is there to care about when tomorrow is the end of summer. Because nicotine and hearse, little matters tomorrow we will jump, our happiness vanished.
So let's do the rounds and the Ronsards, smoke whites and smoke blacks, smile my Bonnie.
Because they will never be able to find us again."
Believe,"[Verse 1]
Even when the thunder and storm begins
I’ll be standing strong like a tree in the wind
Nothing’s gonna move this mountain or change my direction
I’m falling off the sky and I’m all alone
The courage that’s inside is gonna break my fall
Nothing’s gonna dim my light within

[Pre-Chorus]
But if I keep going on
It will never be impossible
Not today...

[Chorus]
‘Cause I’ve got something to believe in
As long as I’m breathing
There is not a limit to what I can dream
‘Cause I got something to believe in
Mission to keep climbing
Nothing else can stop me if I just believe
And I believe in me

[Verse 2]
Even when the world tries to pull me down
Tell me that I can ,try to turn me around
I won’t let them put my fire out, without no

[Pre-Chorus]
But if I keep going on
It will never be impossible
Not today...

[Chorus]
Yes, I got something to believe in
As long as I’m breathing
There is not a limit to what I can dream
‘Cause I got something to believe in
Mission to keep climbing
Nothing else can stop me if I just believe
And I believe

[Bridge]
I can do it all
Open every door
Turn unthinkable to reality
You see, I can do it all and more

[Post-Bridge]
Believe in, as long as I’m breathing
There is not a limit to what I can dream

[Outro-Chorus]
Believing, mission to keep climbing
Nothing else can stop me if I just believe
And I believe in me"

This Is My Life,"I spent my days in vain just waiting
For happiness to come my way
I took for granted all they gave me
I opened my eyes, finally I realised

This is my life
I don't wanna change a thing
This is my life
All the pain, all the joy it brings

All through the years
Of blood, sweat and tears
Hopes and my fears
All that was meant to be
This is my life
What will be, will be

There's no denying all the heartaches
Mmm... were a blessing in disguise
Oh, if I never made a single mistake
Oh, I wouldn't be here, part of the plan I believe

This is my life
I don't wanna change a thing
This is my life
All the pain, all the joy it brings

All through the years
Of blood, sweat and tears
Hopes and my fears
All that was meant to be
This is my life
What will be, will be

I've found the key to set myself free
You'll be amazed
'Cause I have the power to change my ways
This is my life

This is my life
I don't wanna change a thing
This is my life
All the pain, all the joy it brings

All through the years
Of blood, sweat and tears
Hopes and my fears
All that was meant to be

What will be

Brought me nothing but zero

I belong to the stage
Baby, don't call me baby

[Chorus]
Shady lady, I'm gonna strike like thunder
Are you ready? I wanna make you wonder
Rollin' steady, I'm gonna make you shiver
My heart is burning now

[Bridge]
(Shady lady)
(Shady lady)

I wanna light you up and leave you alone
I am a brand new star that you've never known
I wanna light you up and leave you alone
I am a brand new star that you've never known

Shady lady
Are you ready?

[Chorus]
Shady lady, I'm gonna strike like thunder
Are you ready? I wanna make you wonder
Rollin' steady, I'm gonna make you shiver
My heart is burning now"
Nomads in the Night,"Through passing days, I close my eyes and feel silk burning me
Your skin, those gorgeous lips I've kissed so long ago...
Tonight I'll try to rip out this aching heart, it's filled with you
It's filled with lonely pain! Obey

Oh moon, I follow you in darkness
It seems we're nomads in the night
Your cold turns me into the heartless
Until the sunrise burning light
Brings down her sky blue shining eyes

This hollow day, like day before I walk through thousand smiles
And try to find the look that heals all wounds inside
But still I'm here at the worlds' edge falling like a stone to you
Shining so high, alone! Like me

Oh moon, I follow you in darkness
It seems we're nomads in the night
Your cold turns me into the heartless
Until the sunrise burning light...

Oh moon, I follow you in darkness
It seems we're nomads in the night
Your cold turns me into the heartless
Until the sunrise burning light brings down her sky blue shining eyes..."
Zemrën e lamë peng,"Clock like a heart beats
cock of madness fleets
pointers has not
you stole the time
from my life Snow of your voice
upon my heart fell
covered even the last shelter
of Love
Ahhhhhh, naaaaaa And the pointers stop right there Ref.
Day after day, we
beat after beat
searched in vain
a perfect clock
no a heart won't ever be Night after night
beat after beat
departed we
no could not be
coz both of us left hostage the heart
Ahhhhh!!"
Era stupendo,"There’s a part of me
that it doesn’t know to remain silent
when i see the hate that exists
the pain, the poverty
I see myself when i was i child
that I was running in the blue It was wonderful to fly away, to defy the wind, the imagination
your hand and mine, in the same poetry, it was wonderful But one night you’ll see
I’ll get out of my destiny, i promise
if life wait for us
we will return down there It will be wonderful to fly away, to still defy the imagination
and then your hand and mine, in the same poetry
it was wonderful, it was wonderful cause there isn’t peace till
everybody thinks of himself
it was wonderful to fly away, to defy the wind, the imagination...
your hand and mine, in the same poetry.
it was wonderful, it was wonderful"
Have Some Fun,"Sometimes we open a door to hope
Then baby we're hopin' the door won't close
We look all around our future is standing there
Can't you see you're my future?
We really get along
Just like the sun goes with the sunshine
Like a grape goes with a grapevine
But you think In a blink that I'll be bad to you

If you wanna have some fun, don't run
Don't turn away from me when I'm the one
If you wanna know real love and have some fun
Hmm then baby don't run

I know your history makes you shy
Oh babe it's no mystery why you fly
I'm not like the girls ... the girls who just come and go
And with me you won't go solo
We really get along
Just like the stars go with the starshine
Like a ring goes with a bell chime
But you say I won't stay you think I'll pull away

If you wanna have some fun, don't run
Don't turn away from me when I'm the one
I'm the one who shakes your clouds away
Whenever rainy days make you insane
If you wanna have some fun, don't run
Don't walk away when I'm your summer sun
If you wanna know real love and have some fun
Hmm Then baby don't run

I'll even walk you to the moon
Walk down the beach all afternoon
I just wanna be your friend for ... fun fun fun

If you wanna have some fun, don't run
Don't turn away from me when I'm the one
I'm the one who shakes your clouds away
Whenever rainy days make you insane
If you wanna have some fun, don't run
Don't walk away when I'm your summer sun
If you wanna know real love and have some fun
Hmm Then baby don't run"
Hasta la vista,"You shone on me like a blinding star
I've just never seen such a light so far
All my days, like fairy tales

I begged you to look in my loving eyes
But you were as cold as arctic ice
And your laugh has killed my love

The story is close to the final cut
It won't be the end, but a running start
So don't be upset, please don't ask me why
I say goodbye

Hasta la vista, baby
I'm gonna miss you, maybe
You can be really happy
Though it's not fair

Hasta la vista, baby
I'm gonna miss you, maybe
Hasta la vista, blame me
But I don't care

No way to repair the broken glass
There's nothing to share nor to discuss
Now I see, you're not for me
(You're not for me)

You've cast me away to a desert shore
You've shattered my heart, now you keep the score
Have a rest, you've done your best

The story is close to the final cut
It won't be the end, but a running start
So don't you pretend you can't get it why
I say goodbye

Hasta la vista, baby
I'm gonna miss you, maybe
You can be really happy
Though it's not fair

Hasta la vista, baby
I'm gonna miss you, maybe
Hasta la vista, blame me
But I don't care

Hasta la vista
Hasta la vista"
Wolves of the Sea,"[Chorus]
With a ""hi, hi, ho"" and a ""hi, hi, hey""
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea

[Verse 1]
Don't try to run, it's all set and done
There's a treasure inside
We are robbing you blind
I hope you don't mind
We are taking it all tonight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Just walk away, we will conquer it all
Pirates will stand and the loser will fall

[Chorus]
With a ""hi, hi, ho"" and a ""hi, hi, hey""
We're bound to be close to the sea
Our captain will stand on the bridge and sing:
""Pirates are all we can be""

With a ""hi, hi, ho"" and a ""hi, hi, hey""
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea

[Verse 2]
Down to the core, we're coming for more
With a sword close at hand
We are scary and bold, a chest full of gold
We can steal it when sighting land

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Then Hook, our captain is looking at you
There's no Peter Pan, so what can you do?

[Chorus]
With a ""hi, hi, ho"" and a ""hi, hi, hey""
We're bound to be close to the sea
Our captain will stand on the bridge and sing:
""Pirates are all we can be""

With a ""hi, hi, ho"" and a ""hi, hi, hey""
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea

[Bridge]
If you cry out to storm
We pirates will stand tall
A skull and crossbone flag is closing in
To see you fall

(Hum, hi ho, hi hum, hi hey)
(Hum, hi ho, hi hey)
(Hum, hi ho, hi hum, hi hey)

[Chorus]
With a ""hi, hi, ho"" and a ""hi, hi, hey""
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea

With a ""hi, hi, ho"" and a ""hi, hi, hey""
We're bound to be close to the sea
Our captain will stand on the bridge and sing:
""Pirates are all we can be""

With a ""hi, hi, ho"" and a ""hi, hi, hey""
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea
We are wolves of the sea"
Romanca,"See, my friend, I remember everything, and I can tell you, that between this and a million other songs there is no difference Because that life
Erases tracks behind us.
Into a good night,
It lets weird devils in.
So every day is
Illuminated by a cold sun,
And the memories have faded, almost all of them
If you asked me, I'd know just one more thing
That all colours exist only with this rhythm
And night and day are just some verse's trail
And it will disappear when our songs fade out. Play that romance tonight
Quietly, softly that it makes me ill
Tha sadness when a nightingale dies
When soul separates from the body Play that romance tonight
But slowly, so everyone can hear it
May the guitars play again
I haven't listened to them since long ago They tell me today I'm done, technical waste like a monkey up the tree
And I0m the first internet in the world, on ships with music in a net made of planets And now all the dreams of my songs
All fantasies and face that disappeared
Still are a part of my wakenings
Trapped, weaved into me a long time ago Play that romance tonight...."
"DJ, Take Me Away","When the night falls down I want you
DJ please take me away

And when the lights go down I need you
DJ please take me away

I'll take you away

Take me away"
All Night Long,"The sun is up
I'm feeling great
I'm just enjoying life
Right here in the shade
Lets take a ride, right away
I'll be by your side
So easy, the easy life
Celebrate the good times

All night long
All night long
Celebrate good times
Come on
All night long

Who's to tell
What's to come
All I know is tomorrow
Today will be gone
Get out, out of bed
Put on your blue suede shoes
Get up, up and dance
Celebrate the good times

All night long
All night long
Celebrate good times
Come on
All night long

All night long
All night long
Celebrate good times
Come on
All night long

If your life is like a sad song maybe
You should try and celebrate it, celebrate it

All night long

Peace Will Come,"Look, the sky is crying cold bitter tears
Weeping for the people lost in fear
While we fight for nothing, my eyes run dry
Are you still so blind to ask me why? Why?

Say it out loud: peace will come
Everybody, shout: peace will come
When you stop and tame your rage
Something's gotta change, something's gotta change

Say it out loud: peace will come
Everybody, shout: peace will come
Blow the trumpet, beat the drum
Peace will come

Sometimes words kill faster than bullets do
But the face of war is never true
Kids with guns are always too young to die
Are you still so deaf to ask me why? Why?

Say it out loud: peace will come
Everybody, shout: peace will come
When you stop and tame your rage
Something's gotta change, something's gotta change

Say it out loud: peace will come
Everybody, shout: peace will come
Blow the trumpet, beat the drum
Peace will come

My land is still crying, torn in half
My world is slowly dying, my heart is only crying
Peace and love, oh no, no, no

Say it out loud: peace will come
Everybody, shout: peace will come
When you stop and tame your rage
Something's gotta change, something's gotta change

Say it out loud: peace will come
Everybody, shout: peace will come
Blow the trumpet, beat the drum
Peace will come

Blow the trumpet, beat the drum
Peace will come"
Candlelight (Szívverés),"Weeks go by
Summer scents expire
Autumn leaves, memories
An untold desire
It burns in me
Waiting patiently
Never sleeps or tires
But grows by the hour
Come (and) wake me from this lonely place
All I want is you
If you take me to the stars and back
I will know my dream is true
I will fly tonight
Forever keep you in my heart
Make it feel so right
When you love me by sweet
Candlelight
Hold me ‘till the morning shine
All my fears subside
When I look into your eyes
So step inside
And place your hand into mine
What you are is a blessing to my life
Hát Istenem most légy velem küldd el hozzám ?t
Nem számít mennyi még, olyan jó rá várni
I will fly tonight
Forever keep you in my heart
Make it feel so right
When you love me by sweet
Candlelight
Hold me ‘till the morning shine
All my fears subside
When I look into your eyes"

Femme fatale,"Hello hood, I’m woman
and I belong to a gender that you call it weak,
delicate, thinner and weaker
than every male that wanders to the café. The good God felt sorry for me
and He gave me a weapon that makes me strong.
He told me “don’t you be afraid my girl
you’ll always have the man at your service”. Bam and down, I caught you in my net
and with one glance of mine I mist your look.
Bam and I got into your dreams
and watch out cause I’m a Goddess. Bam and down, you caught me in your net
and with one glance of yours you mist my look.
Femme fatale you got into my dreams
and I must be careful cause you’re a Goddess. And you continuously to talk to me, full of passion to look at me
like a sweet, loyal guard you follow me again. Bam and your mind stack again
to the spells that my sauciness did to you.
Bam you fell down my boy
and the weak gender enslaves your heart. And I continuously to talk to you, full of passion to look at you
like a sweet, loyal guard I follow you again. And bam and down you fell in my net
and with a shake of mine I agitate the waters.
Femme fatale I got into your dreams
and you’ll get burnt cause I’m a Goddess. Bam and your mind stack again
to the spells that my sauciness did to you.
Bam and all of you, you got hurt

Let Me Love You,"Let's go, let's go, let's go
What'cha gonna do if I let you know
You're the only one I've been dreaming of
I've never felt love like this before

Let's go, let's go, let's go
Where the moon is full and the lights are low
We can do it so slow, kiss in slow-mo
Until dawn breaks, then I ride out solo

You always knew how to make me cry
I feel so helpless without you
I'm starting to lose my mind
I wanna be with you tonight

The stars above glow like they're making love
I'm running under the moonlight
Alone in this sleepless night
Just to be right by your side

Let me love you
Let me love you
Unfold your angel wings
Fly out from my wildest dreams
Let me love you
Let me love you
Kiss me and let me die
Before you say goodbye

Let's go, let's go, let's go
What'cha gonna do if I let you know
You're the only one I've been dreaming of
I've never felt love like this before
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Where the moon is full and the lights are low
We can do it so slow, kiss in slow-mo
Until dawn breaks, then I ride out solo

You always knew how to make me cry
Who needs a smile when my tears
Are so full of love inside
And they are stronger than my pride

Let me love you
Let me love you
Unfold your angel wings
Fly out from my wildest dreams
Let me love you
Let me love you
Kiss me and let me die
Before you say goodbye"

Even If,"You’re keeping me fascinated
Know I’m runnin’ all over town
I feel so intoxicated

And for the first time
I’m not looking for love

So come here, baby, listen to me
I just want ya to believe me

Even if the world stops lovin’
I could never stop lovin’ you
Even if the sun stops risin’

I could never break your heart too
Even if all words lost their meaning
You would understand I love you
Yes, I do

Your sensuality thrills me
It strips me to my soul
And so reality cures me
Your lovin’ takes a hold
I’m barely in control

I’m not pretendin’, girl
That ain’t what’s goin’ on
There’s no room for lies
Ain’t no room at all

Disappear,"On and on I've tried to move it along
(It won't stop)
Tried to find the strength to turn it around
(It won't stop)
Everything's been off since you went away
And time just broke the promise to ease the pain

Because I need you here
And it's just not fair
That it won't get better
Why did you disappear
And we got nowhere
But it won't stop there
Though you're gone forever
I can't make you disappear

Crashing,breaking memories in my mind
(It won't stop)
Never ever close to getting it right
(It won't stop)
Best time of my life now it's washed away
Still the stars they know how to spell your name

Cause I need you here
And it's just not fair
That it won't get better
Why did you disappear
And we got nowhere
But it won't stop there
Though you're gone forever
I can't make you disappear

Cause you got into my heart of stone
And I can't get used to being all alone

Cause I need you here
And it's just not fair
That it won't get better
Why did you disappear
And we got nowhere
But it won't stop there
Though you're gone forever
I can't make you disappear"

And I love you much too much
Get out of my life, babe

Just get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Just get out of my, out of my, out of my bed
It's beyond belief, but true
I became a slave to you

Just get out of my, out of my, out of my dreams
Just get out of my, out of my, out of my scenes
Where I lose all of my drive
While I'm fighting to survive

Just get out of my life
Get out of my life

Well, you are like a moonbeam that makes me feel so lonely
You are like a mountain and I'm afraid to fall
Every time I'm certain you are my one and only
I know if you leave me, I'll lose it all

'Cause you're overwhelming me
You're too perfect, can't you see?
Please, get out of my life

Just get out of my, out of my, out of my head
Just get out of my, out of my, out of my bed
It's beyond belief, but true
I became a slave to you

Just get out of my, out of my, out of my dreams
Just get out of my, out of my, out of my scenes
Where I lose all of my drive
While I'm fighting to survive
Just get out of my life

Because I love you
More than you will ever know
Would be hard to let you go
But get out of my life
Get out of my life

It's beyond belief, but true
I became a slave to you

Copycat,"Way down in Memphis, Tennessee
There’s a guy looking just like me
Wearing the same blue suede shoes
Singing the same old blues
Way down in the U.S. of A.
There’s a guy doing things my way
Combing the same greasy hair
Hugging the same teddy bear
He’s a copycat trying to steal my soul
But he’s too fat to rock ‘n’ roll
He’s a copycat trying to steal my soul
But he’s too fat to rock ‘n’ roll
Way down in the deep deep South
There’s a guy with a girly mouth
Eating the same banana sandwich
Dressed in the same kind of kitsch
Way down by the Mississippi river
There’s a guy with a voice that quivers
Driving the same Cadillac car
Chasing the same lucky star
He’s a copycat trying to steal my soul
But he’s too fat to rock ‘n’ roll
He’s a copycat trying to steal my soul
But he’s too fat to rock ‘n’ roll
Way down in America
There’s a guy, rich and arrogant
Dating my fair Priscilla
He makes me want to hire a killer
Way down in the land of the brave
There’s a guy lying in his grave
Cause nobody duplicating my jive
Will never get away with that alive
He was a copycat trying to steal my soul
Now he’s too dead to rock ‘n’ roll
He was a copycat trying to steal my soul
Now he’s too dead to rock ‘n’ roll"
Eyes That Never Lie,"I was wandering alone
I was turning to stone
I was going insane
When you came into my life

You chased sorrow away
You changed night into day
You cured all of my pain
With your eyes that never lie

All my life I waited
Thinking I would never fly
Then you looked and saw my wings
With your eyes that never lie

You are my desert and well
You are my heaven and hell
You are my reason to be
My love song, my battle cry

I know I will be whole
While I keep in my soul
The light shining on me
From your eyes that never lie

All my life I waited
Thinking I would never fly
Then you looked and saw my wings
With your eyes that never lie

Oh, my darling angel
Guide me through despair in the sky
If I'm lost I'll see the way
In your eyes that never lie"
La voix,"Oho ....

Can you keep a secret? (bis)

The Highest Heights,"I climb a tree, so mighty high
I see the world from just beneath the sky
The dreams I dream, they take me high

The air is thin, my thoughts are clear
I can feel something is in the atmosphere
The dreams I dream, they take me here
Beyond the last frontier

The time is now, there’s no excuse
Everyone I know, I hope you like the news
The time has come, the curtains call

Will you catch me when I fall? Oh yeah
From the highest heights of all? Oh yeah

I climb this tree, the highest heights
From beneath the stars, I see little lights
The dreams I dream demand their rights
I’ve got no head for heights

The time is now, so stop the tease
And may I have your attention, please
The time has come, the curtains call

Will you catch me when I fall?
From the highest heights of all?

How will I ever know?
I’ve always gotta know
Will you catch me?

Will you catch me when I fall?
From the highest heights of all?

How will I ever know?
I’ve always gotta know
Will you catch me?"

The Balkan Girls,"The Balkan girls, they like to party
Like nobody, like nobody

It's time for me to unwind
I'm gonna start my weekend with a tonic and lime
My girls take me for a ride
Ready to party and looking so fine

I wonder if beyond this
There could be something better
'Cause I feel so good tonight
Don't wanna end this night

The Balkan girls, they like to party
Like nobody, like nobody
(The groovy light will shine all night)
The Balkan girls, they like to party
Like nobody, like nobody

My hips are ready to glow
This record is so hot and I have so much to show
I'll find a boy for a kiss
Who knows, maybe he'll be my prince

I wonder if beyond this
There could be something better
'Cause I feel so good tonight
Don't wanna end this night

What love is about
And if you're a lonely baby
Just open your mind, you're one of a kind

Lose Control,"[Intro]
I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
Falling down

[Verse 1]
I got this panic emotion that I cannot describe to you
My world is tumbelling down what am I, what am I gonna do
Ca-can't deny it, deny it, what am I going through
Ca-can not fight it, can fight it, now I'm looking for the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna live a lie / Checking on my sanity
'Cause maybe baby I can do without / Is it all a fantasy?
I don't wanna live a lie / Is this my reality?
It's spinning round and round day and night

[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
I just can't believe it
Never thought that I would be the one
Falling down

I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
I just can't believe it
Never thought that I would be the one
Falling down

[Verse 2]
I'm on a critical mission, got my destiny in my hands
Like Peter Piper I take control put a spell on the mass
I cause hysteria, worry yourself, that's how I roll
It's not a drill, I'm for real, I'm a man who's out of control

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna live a lie / Checking on my sanity
'Cause maybe baby I can do without / Is it all a fantasy?
I don't wanna live a lie / Is this my reality?
It's spinning round and round day and night

[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
I just can't believe it
Never thought that I would be the one
Falling down

I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
I just can't believe it
Never thought that I would be the one
Falling down

[Bridge]
I'm falling, I'm falling
And I just can't believe it
I'm falling, I'm falling down

[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
I just can't believe it
Never thought that I would be the one
Falling down

I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
I just can't believe it
Never thought that I would be the one
Falling down"
Todas as ruas do amor,"If I were paint, you would be canvas
If I were rain, you would be aquarelle
If I were salt, you would be white sand

If I were the sky, you would be a cloud in it
If I were a star, you would be the charming
If I were night, you would be its light
If I were daylight, you would be the moonlight I’m the voice of the heart
I’m an open letter to the world
I’m the mirror of emotion
Of your deep look.
I’m complete
In a second
I give my body
Like a lover
I’m the time that doesn’t pass
When the lonely feeling
gets a hold on me Kiss the sea, the wind and the moon.
I’m a sun
in naked snow. In all the streets
of love
You’ll be mine and I’ll be yours. If I were paint, you would be canvas

What If We,"Words of wisdom, prophets and quotes;
Wise men talking, tales from the old
I reach for the stars
Wherever they are
In darkness we're lost, fading away

What if we could be free?
Mystify our wisdom in time
And one day we'll see
What if we found the key?
Throw the dice, unravel our lives
And learn how to be

All the madness feeding our soul
Take a wild guess out of control
There will be a star
No matter how far, shining
One day we'll sail away

What if we could be free?
Mystify our wisdom in time
And one day we'll see
What if we found the key?
Throw the dice, unravel our lives
And learn how to be

If you don't know your destination
Who determines your destiny?

What if we could be free?
Mystify our wisdom in time
And one day we'll see
What if we found the key?
Throw the dice, unravel our lives
And learn how to be"
Bistra voda,"I asked some people
in my birthplace, where my soul lives
They say that you keep a secret
away from me, my dear I asked them to give me back
that time, the old hours, spring
They say that love has got a scent
They say so Give birth to me in May dawn
Bathe me in clear water
I keep a flower when everybody goes (away)
I keep you as long as I live Steal a bit Sun for us
You don't have tomorrow, you don't have today
It is easy when the song finds your heart Give birth to me in May dawn..."

Probka (Пробка),"Cork!
Everyone is tired -
Like this!
Grey faces
Nerves -
If  only to enter
The first!
And everywhere
Got up
The boxes
Of steel.
Suddenly I see -
Above
Jumps on
The roofs
A girl … Jumping ahead - straight
From Merc to Volvo.
I rub my eyes - maybe it's a mirage,
But my eyes already hurt. Hey, take me upstairs with you!
I'm tired of trumpeting myself
I want to walk on the bumpers,
I'm not screwed tightly! Only I don't know who you are,
But I want to go just next to you.
See how the wind below bends bushes
On the side of a clogged roundabout. How so?
From the window to me
The Fist!
So you and
Rastak!
And I only
Jumping gallop.
From my pants
Shred
I left,
God bless him!
Farther -
What is the strength!
I breathe often
CO2
My head is dizzy.. This fun is Uneasy -
From Merc to Volvo.
And your silhouette swings
Far enough Hey, wait, take me with you!
I'm tired of trumpeting myself
I want to walk on the bumpers,
But I'm not screwed tightly!"
Cipela (Ципела),"My old shoe has seen half of the world
Wherever I stay, is my home
From here to there, from east to south
Wherever I come, I've been there before The panic grips a hold on me, that old habit
My heart would set off in front of her
And I'd become, an old fool
Well, let everything perish, I'll keep on with that She didn't didn't didn't want me
If I didn't spend all my money
She didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't want me
If I wasn't utterly rich"
I Don't Wanna Leave,"I can't say the words I feel inside so deep
'Cause when the clouds come out, I feel so incomplete
I know the sun shines down on me
I see it now, the rain won't get to me
I just wanna live my life the way it's meant to be

I don't wanna leave, but it's my destiny
I will wrap my arms around the world, you'll see
That I am not a child, 'cause I'm standing taller this time
Take it step by step, do my best, that's right
But I will never say goodbye

For so long now I've been dreaming in the dark
I was too scared to feel the things held in my heart
Don't you know this is meant to be, I'll let it out
'Cause it's getting hard to breathe
I just wanna live my life the way it's meant to be

I don't wanna leave, but it's my destiny
I will wrap my arms around the world, you'll see
That I am not a child, 'cause I'm standing taller this time
Take it step by step, do my best, that's right

Oh... I don't wanna leave, I don't wanna leave
But it's my destiny, oh...

I'll never say goodbye...

Never, oh...

Fairytale,"[Verse 1]
Years ago, when I was younger
I kinda liked a girl I knew
She was mine and we were sweethearts
That was then, but then it’s true

[Chorus 1]
I’m in love with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
’Cause I don’t care if I lose my mind
I’m already cursed

[Verse 2]
Every day, we started fighting
Every night, we fell in love
No one else could make me sadder
But no one else could lift me high above
I don’t know what I was doing
When suddenly, we fell apart
Nowadays, I cannot find her
But when I do, we’ll get a brand-new start

[Chorus 1]
I’m in love with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
’Cause I don’t care if I lose my mind
I’m already cursed

[Chorus 2]
She’s a fairytale, yeah
Even though it hurts
’Cause I don’t care if I lose my mind
I’m already cursed"
Firefly,"It's a question that drives us where we must go
It's the unknown that drives from us what we want most
But the firefly sits in the corner and rests

And he won't care of you stare
But believe me, it's best to let go
Don't just go with the flow

And the firefly comes to you, sits on your finger
It shatters and shakes, but she wants you to go with her now
Follow her out there

The firefly, spreading her wings open wide
Thinks the sky will come crashing down, fall to her side
She's afraid, but her fear's only fair

So fly with the firefly, fly side by side
Escaping the chains that held you from life
Don't look down, you're over the edge

Jump, take the leap of faith
Jump, take the leap of faith

It's a question that drives us to where we must go
It's the unknown that drives from us what we want most
But the firefly sits in the corner and rests

(It's a question that drives us to where we must go)
(It's the unknown that drives from us what we want most)
Don't just go with the flow
(But the firefly sits in the corner and rests)

It's a question that drives us to where we must go
It's the unknown that drives from us what we want most
But the firefly sits in the corner and rests

(It's a question that drives us to where we must go)
(It's the unknown that drives from us what we want most)
Don't just go with the flow
(But the firefly sits in the corner and rests)

Leť tmou,"I feel cold and guileful shadows
what is at the bottom glows with desire
Emptiness in a soul, that happens
Gloom has a bitter taste We have to come out of shadows, snares and words
Give your heart, don't be hopeless and fly through the dark I can feel it too, i'm scared too
A dream is shivering with my fear
A moment of loss, a moment of fear
When the hope is lying in a dust We have to come out of shadows, snares and words
Give your heart, don't be hopeless and fly through the dark We have to come out of shadows, snares and words
Give your heart, don't be hopeless and fly through the dark But where?
I don't know know, everybody makes mistakes
Silence whispers in me: don't stay alone I can feel it too, i'm scared too
Don't stay alone When the forgiveness is close
It sends away clouds of concerns
You won't stray, you're sure
when somebody secures you firmly God let your voice
Lead us through the dark in us
Give us a present, make a wonder, give back the love
Love, please Love, please let your voice
Lead us through the dark in us
Give us a present, make a wonder, stand with us Love, please let your voice
Lead us through the dark in us
Give us a present, make a wonder, stand with us
Protect love"
Believe Again,"You made it so easy to fall
I could not stand at all
I saw you beside me
You never saw me there at all

I promised you all this
I made plans thinking this was it
I never imagined I'd find you
Lose myself instead

I never had a picture of an end

And I... I wanna believe in love
I wanna believe in something bigger
Than the two of us, yeah...
I... I wanna breathe again
I wanna go back to the days
The days I had my innocence

I wanna believe again
I picked up the pieces
And put them back where they belong
But something is missing
Though I look the same, I'm not as strong
But I'm gonna learn to trust again

And I... I wanna believe in love
I wanna believe in something bigger
Than the two of us (The two of us)
And I... I wanna breathe again
I wanna go back to the days
The days I had my innocence
I wanna believe again

For without love, what do we become?
I never had a picture of an end

And I... I wanna believe in love
I wanna believe in something bigger
Than the two of us (The two of us)
I... I wanna breathe again
I wanna believe
I wanna believe
I wanna believe again"
Love Symphony (Simfonija),"Imagine you and me
We’re flying above the sea
Feeling free in this love symphony

Imagine you and me
We’re flying above the sea
Feeling free in this love symphony

Out of time, out of place
Somewhere inside my universe
Where you live your dreams

Imagine you and me
We’re flying above the sea
Feeling free eternally
Like in this love symphony"
Dance with Me,"I see it in your eyes, you wanna dance with me tonight
It’s raining on your body as you’re puttin’ up a fight
The way you’re moving, how you groove is somewhere out of sight
You know it’s only fair to tell you that you do it right

Now with a little luck, I’m gonna meet you on the dance floor
Just by the way you move, you make me beg for more
I’m burning with desire, it’s the night I’ve waited for

Don’t you lose your emotion
Don’t you be shy tonight
Let the rhythm show you
Baby, you can do it right
Alright tonight

Come on, dance with me, make me lose my way
Take a chance with me, make my body sway
It’s an overload in a disco fantasy
Let’s dance the night away

Just yesterday we were on the floor
Like somewhere in a movie or a club in Singapore
The lights are bright, the mood is raw
And in the middle of the night, we dance till we get sore
And in the middle of the night, I’ll meet you on the dancefloor
Gonna meet you, move your body, beg for more
With a rhythm and a beat, I’ll rock you to the core

Don’t you lose your emotion
Don’t you be shy tonight
Let the rhythm show you
Baby, you can do it right
Alright tonight

Come on, dance with me, make me lose my way
Take a chance with me, make my body sway
It’s an overload in a disco fantasy
Let’s dance the night away

Dance with me
Dance dance dance with me
Dance with me

Come on, dance with me, make me lose my way
Take a chance with me, make my body sway
It’s an overload in a disco fantasy
Let’s dance the night away

Come on, dance with me, make me lose my way
Take a chance with me, make my body sway
It’s an overload in a disco fantasy
Let’s dance the night away"
Always,"[Intro]
Ohh, ohh, ohhh
Always on my mind
Always in my heart

[Verse 1]
I've been waiting for you night after night
Like a shadow, staying close to the light
Suddenly you stand beside me
And I see a million burning stars

[Chorus]
You are always on my mind, always in my heart
And I can hear you call my name on a mountain high
Always on my mind, always in my dreams
I wanna hold you close to me, always, all the time

[Verse 2]
I believe I'm addicted to you
In your eyes I see dreams comin' true
Finally I have found you
And now I will never let you go, no

[Chorus]
You are always on my mind, always in my heart
And I can hear you call my name on a mountain high
Always on my mind, always in my dreams
I wanna hold you close to me, always, all the time

[Bridge]
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahhhh

[Chorus]
Always on my mind, always in my heart
And I can hear you call my name on a mountain high
Always on my mind, always in my dreams
I wanna hold you close to me, always, all the time

Always on my mind, always in my heart
Always on my mind, always in my dreams
Always, all the time"
This Is Our Night,"Take a chance, and take a hold
Give it all, and turn it to gold
Time has come, so make a stand
On your own, and take command
Beat the odds, you will survive
Stronger now, you feel alive
Rising up, get into place
Feel it in your heart
When you are, winning this race
When I look into your eyes
It comes, as no surprise

[ Chorus ] x 2
This is our night, fly, to the top baby
Yes we can do it, just wait and see
This is our night, time, for a change baby
Get rid of the old, take a hold, and be free

[-Chorus ]
This is our night
Counting down, the night of nights
Getting now, to stand and fight
Don't back down, just look within
Do it now, I know you will
When I look into your eyes
It comes as no surprise"
Love,"I've had it all, as a little child
I've done it all, as a little child
But the pain that I had
For the fame that I got, was for what?

A little girl is crying alone
A little boy, searching for his home
Giving up to a sin for a heart-craving dream
Is that a sin?

If you really love the love you say you love, really love
Then surely that love would love
Then surely that love would love to love you back

If you really love the love you say you love, really love
Then surely that love would love
Then surely that love will love you back

For just one moment, we all wanna be
Just as happy as one can be
(So don't you make the same mistake)
(You gotta give for what you take)
And don't you break

A little girl or boy crying at home alone
A faithful song will lead the way
To make you strong

If you really love the love you say you love, really love
Then surely that love would love
Then surely that love would love to love you back

If you really love the love you say you love, really love
Then surely that love would love
Then surely that love

If you really love
If you really love the love you say you love, really love
Then surely that love would love
Then surely that love would love to love you back

If you really love the love you say you love, really love
Then surely that love would love

Then surely that love, then surely that love
Then surely that love will love you back
Will love you back"

Rändajad,"The nomads
In the desert heat the sand
Blows like ice-cold snow
The night soon unfurls its wings
Leaving nothing but the wind to escort the nomads It is the way
They wander from one day to the next
It is the way
They wander from one time to the next
It is the way
It weaves an invisible path
Before them
Waiting until you dare to take the risk It conveys only frozen souls
The moonlight makes shadows of them
Warmth in a ray of sunlight
Is what the morning brings once again It is the way
They wander from one day to the next
It is the way
They wander from one time to the next
It is the way
It weaves an invisible path
Before them
Waiting until you dare to take the risk They wander from one day to the next
They wander from one time to the next
It weaves an invisible path
It waits until you are ready to take the risk A voice echoes over the mountains up to the heavens It is the way
They wander from one day to the next
It is the way
They wander from one time to the next
It is the way
It weaves an invisible path
Before them
Waiting until you dare to take the risk
It is the way"
Shine,"(Shine, shine, shine)

There are so many wars right now in this world
There are so many things not right
There are too many people hurt in this world
There are too many men that fight

Time is now to make the change
Time is on our side
Love will make us glow in the dark
So open up your heart
Are you ready for a brand new start?

People, let your light shine
Let the darkness fade away
Step into a brighter day
Don't forget about our world today

Let your light shine
Maybe the answer is just this simple song
Let everybody shine along
To keep the world from going wrong
Let your light shine

So many people with good heart in this world
So many, they can make a change
So the only thing that we have to do
Is love the one we hate

It will change all darkness into bright
It will touch everybody's light
The whole world will be lighted
All people will be reunited

(Shine)
People, let your light shine
Let the darkness fade away
Step into a brighter day
Don't forget about the role you must play

Let your light shine
Maybe the answer is just this simple song
Let everybody shine along
To keep the world from going wrong
Let your light shine

As long as we believe in good in each man
As long as we believe in love
The light will guide and take us to
The world we all dream of
Let your light shine

Let everybody shine along

Et s'il fallait le faire,"& If I had to do it
I would stop the earth
I would switch off the light
So you stay asleep
If I had , to please you ,
To make inverse winds blow ,
In a lifeless desert
I would find the sea ..
& If I had to do it
I would stop the rain
It would go back
For the rest of our lives
If I had , to please you ,
To listen to you every night
When you speak about love ,
I would speak about it too .. So you still watch
Deep inside my eyes
So you still see there
The greatest of the great fires
& So your hand sticks
To my skin , wherever it wants
One day if you fly away
I will follow you , if I can .. & If I had to do it ,
I would keep the winter away
With big blows of spring
& Long clear mornings
If I had to , to please you
I would stop the time
So all your words of yesterday
Stay mines now So I still watch
The blue of your eyes
So your two hands still
Get lost in my hair
I would make everything greater
& If it's too much or not enough ,
I would be wrong all the time
If that's what you want
I really want to give it all
If only you believe in it
My heart really wants to bleed
If only you see it
Until I'm nothing
But the shadow of your nights
Until I'm nothing
But a shadow that follows you . & If I had to do it .."
Mamo (Мамо),"Out of the shadows once again, my enemy, my love
My destiny can’t be avoided, no matter how much you’re prepared
But before you left with a golden ring
You proposed to me and didn’t save me from sorcery
And didn’t let my soul be free
Mother, you’ve been telling me not to desire
Mother, at that time I didn’t know where trouble lied
Mother, you’ve been telling me that time is like water
Mother, mother, mother, love is trouble
I will throw away my dream and crush it on the floor
How you’ve broken my destiny and set it aside
I will pour girl’s tears like rain
Mother, you’ve been telling me not to desire
Mother, at that time I didn’t know where trouble lied
Mother, you’ve been telling me that time is like water
Mother, mother, mother, love is trouble
Mother, at that time I didn’t know where trouble lied
Mother, you’ve been telling me that time is like water
Mother, mother, mother, love is trouble

Over the clouds, under the sky
Never come back, no, run away
With all your might, give up, you

I don't believe anymore your shallow heart
I know that it's you who chose to play this trick
O'll never forgive you, not for anything!
And now you are left with nothing

Just run away from my mind
Oh, forgive, I don't need
I won't breathe!
Just get away from my life

Oh, forget, let me breathe, let me live!
Just run away from my mind
Oh, forgive, I don’t need
I won't breathe!

Happiness. You have mistaken
We have no progressive future!
I know your lying nature

Horehronie,"When the sun goes down in Horehronie
I want to sing, die and live
When the sun goes down in Horehronie
I wish I could get closer to the sky I'm lying on the grass and dreaming
Of what, I don't even know
In the breeze that gently sways me
When the sun is at its lowest point The most beautiful trees are in Horehronie
A silent brotherhood is telling that
I come back here when I feel sad
The trees are saying: shake it off I'm lying on the grass and dreaming
Of what, I don't even know
In the breeze that gently sways me
When the sun is at its lowest point Ah... hallelujah... When the sun goes down in Horehronie
Out there somewhere far away our bell is ringing
When it hurts, let it hurt
One day it will vanish in the black mountain I'm lying on the grass and dreaming
My eyes are crying softly
In the breeze that gently sways me
When the sun is at its lowest point Ah... ah... ah... ah... I'm lying on the grass and dreaming
My eyes are crying softly
In the breeze that gently sways me
When the sun is at its lowest point The most beautiful trees are in Horehronie"

And rivers flow?

And mountains high?

I've asked my uncle Joe
But he can't speak
Why does the wind still blow?
And blood still leaks?
So many questions now

What for are we dying?
Only Mr. God knows why

What for are we dreaming?
What for are we loosing?

Thunder and Lightning,"Say just one more word
And you will make it end
And I will leave this place
Only anger will remain
And it doesn't seem to me
We're each other's better side
These days

This is the time to melt the ice
Off our lips and off our hearts
Thunder and lightning holding hands
Let's overcome the past

The drought is all around
But if we start breathing together
We can bring the rain down
For a dream, for a brand new day
To wash away our sins
And carry them away

This is the time to melt the ice
Off our lips and off our hearts
Thunder and lightning holding hands
Let's overcome the past
We have to do it fast

This is the time (to melt the ice)
(Off our lips and off our hearts) Off our hearts
(Thunder and lightning holding hands)
Thunder and lightning
(Let's overcome the past)
(We have to do it fast)

In this crazy world
In this crazy world
Just you and I

Say just one more word
And everything will end, everyone will leave"
Legenda,"Over the forest, over the mountain
There once lived a knight called “Peacock Feather”
Every day I think about tomorrow
Wanna see my princess much closer
I’ve decided, never feeling sorrow
I will share my heart when I find her
I’ll be forever, ever and ever
Feeling this love till the day when I die
Being together, even no matter
You didn’t want me to be by your side
He kidnapped a girl from the castle
The chase after him was a failure
Lovely princess, I am here to save you
Take my hand and say that you love me
If you ever say it, even lying
I’ll let you fly like a bird – free
I’ll be forever, ever and ever
Feeling this love till the day when I die
Being together, even no matter
You didn’t want me to be by your side
I’ll be forever, ever and ever
Feeling this love till the day when I die
Being together, even no matter
You didn’t want me to be by your side
(I’ll be forever, ever and ever) I’ll be forever…
(Feeling this love till the day when I die)
(Being together, even no matter) No, no, no
(You didn’t want me to be by your side) You didn’t want me to be by…
(The moral of this is that)
(She didn’t like the knight)
Till the day I die…

(She didn’t like the knight)

Me and My Guitar,"[Verse 1]
People always say: ""Tom, this is going too far""
I'm not afraid to chase my dreams
Just me and my guitar

And no one may ever know
The feelings inside my mind
Cause all of the lines I ever write
Are running out of time
So maybe I should get a nine to five
But I don't wanna let it go
There's so much more to life

[Chorus]
Tell me, did I get it wrong?
Tell me everything will be okay
Before I fall
And tell me they'll play my songs
And tell me they'll sing the words I'll sing
When darkness falls
All of the stars will see
Just me and my guitar

[Verse 2]
I'm sure that I'll find my way
Cause I'm not afraid to try
But even a world of love and hope
Can't guarantee that prize

So maybe I can get that nine to five
And I don't wanna let it go
There's so much more to life (Nooo ooh)

[Chorus]
Tell me, did I get it wrong?
Tell me everything will be okay
And before I fall, no no
Tell me they'll play my songs
And tell me they'll sing the words I'll sing
When darkness falls
All of the stars will see
Just me and my guitar
Me and my guitar (oh oh)
Me and my guitar ( mhhm mhhm)"
My Dream,"We used to say that dreams could be so true
Where am I? What will I be?
It’s my dream which I could share with you
A new day for you and me
Just a smile with warmth in my heart and go all the way
There’s so much in life and I’ll sing

This is my dream, I want to make it really happen
And make my dream come true
This is my dream, I’ll make it if I just believe it
In a fairytale I’ll live it, just like a new born star

Fly above like a seagull on the waves
And the sun will shine upon your face
Just believe, follow your heart and make it happen
Grow much brighter and we’ll say

This is my dream, I want to make it really happen
And make my dream come true
This is my dream, I’ll make it if i just believe it
There is nothing that could stop me
I just want the world to know

This is my dream, and I know that I’ll be strong
It will come true because I know I’ll make it happen
This is my dream"
It's All About You,"[Verse 1]
You are the one
You give me the something I need
It's me, and I'm calling
You are the one
Making it easy to me
In love with you I'm falling

[Pre-Chorus]
We've been down
But don't you know it went down here
And I feel it
Even now
Time that we make a deal
And seal it

[Chorus]
It's all about you
The things that I do
The rest of the world don't understand me
You're all that I dream
Everything that I need
'Cause when you are gone, I feel so empty
It's all in the way you look at me
You're driving me crazy
It's all about you
All the things that I do
You are my life
'Cause you make it amazing

[Violin Solo]

[Verse 2]
I'm the one
Who doesn't know how to say no
To you, I'm so easy
I'm the one
Who's letting my ego just go
For you complete me

[Pre-Chorus]
We've been down (Been down, some day)
But something tells me
It's only getting better (It's getting better)
So stick around
I wanna know what it feels like
Forever and ever

[Chorus]
It's all about you (All about you)
The things that I do (Things that I do)
The rest of the world don't understand me
You're all that I dream
Everything that I need (Things that I need)
'Cause when you are gone, (Uh) I feel so empty
It's all in the way you look at me
You're driving me crazy
It's all about you
All the things that I do
You are my life
'Cause you make it amazing

[Bridge]
I'm never alone
With the love that you give me
Wherever I go
I'm hoping you miss me
Don't wanna ever go back
Never ever go back
Baby you're my destiny, oh yeah

[Chorus]
It's all about you (All about you)
The things that I do (Things that I do)
The rest of the world don't understand me
You're all that I dream
Everything that I need (Things that I need)
'Cause when you are gone, (Uh) I feel so empty
It's all in the way you look at me
You're driving me crazy
It's all about you
All the things that I do
You are my life
'Cause you make it amazing, oh yeah
It's all about you"
OPA (ΩΠΑ),"opa,opa
I burned ""yesterdays"" ,nights of the past
the memories turned to smithereens as well
memories and screams,pointless wishes
In some corner(of my mind)i've left open wounds I burned ""yesterdays"",nights of the past
on fire I set dreams and nightmares
tears that burn,many lies
they look like a silent movie that I no longer watch opa I set on fire
everything that belongs on the past
I'll change everything
and I'll shout:
we can forget about the past and make a new beginning I set on fire
everything that belongs on past
I'll change everything
and I'll shout:
we can forget about the past and make a new beginning I burned ""yesterdays"",nights of the past
and I start all over again even if you don't want me to
Tears that burn,many lies
I paid for everything I owed and for all my debts"
Há dias assim,"There are days like this
That leave us lonely
The empty soul
The sorrow in the voice We consumed our hands
Because we squeezed them so much
There are no words left
Because we silenced them so much There is a song
That I didn't sing to you
Verses yet to be rhymed
Poems that I have never invented Who turned us like this?
A torn life
Who took you away from me
Stole my soul
But s/he doesn't know anything about you There are days like this
We don't need to hide
To fear words
To love or to suffer To conceal feelings
To pretend that they don't exist
There are lost days
Between here and there There is a song
That I didn't sing to you
Verses yet to be rhymed
Poems that I have never invented Who turned us like this?
A torn life
Who took you away from me
Stole my soul
But s/he doesn't know anything about you I know that one day you will know
That there is only one life
And no way back Who turned us like this?
A torn life
Who took you away from me
Stole my soul
But s/he doesn't know anything about you"
Jas ja imam silata (Јас ја имам силата),"A new day is waking
But the rain will come to us again
This gravestone by me is you Don't touch these lips of mine, that isn't you
Leave me to dream, though a dream with you is just a dream I have the strength to get over you
To not have you, and to not see you
And I spread my wings to fly over you
Through all, through all the heavens Look, I'm going, to feel the warm wind on my face again
It's good to be free and alone
Free and alone I have the strength to get over you
To not have you, and to not see you
And I spread my wings to fly over you
Through all, through all the heavens A day is waking, a new day, a new problem
You're here with me, but again I'm lonely
I'm running from everything, even running from you
Little woman I just need to be by myself
I want to dream, I wanted to dream
But a dream with you is only a dream
And I have the strength to realise that you were never mine, ha I have the strength to get over you
To not have you, and to not see you
And I spread my wings to fly over you
Through all, through all the heavens I have the strength to get over you
To not have you, and to not see you
And I spread my wings to fly over you
Through all, through all the heavens"
Butterflies,"I'm gonna tell you what 's inside my soul
We are so fragile, just like melting snow
We've got to come to see the beauty of love
And imagine, and imagine, just imagine

And we're like butterflies flying to the sun
The sun will never let us look inside
I believe that this'll be opened up
But at the right time
Heartfully just wait for it, it will come

And even if you often were so wrong
And you denied the miracle's possible
But you have got to see it anyway
And imagine, and imagine, just imagine

And we're like butterflies flying to the sun
The sun will never let us look inside
I believe that this'll be opened up
But at the right time
Heartfully just wait for it, it will come

And we're like butterflies flying to the sun (The sun)
The sun will never let us look inside (Look inside, I believe)
I believe that this'll be opened up
But at the right time
Heartfully just wait for it
And all the secrets will come, come out"

Now I look up and see the brightest sky above me
And it's reflecting in your eyes

Je ne sais quoi, I know you have a special something
Je ne sais quoi, oh, something I just can't explain
And when I see your face I wanna follow my emotions
Je ne sais pas, pourquoi?

When the clouds are gone the stars come out around us, shining
And all that we see is the love, our hearts aligned together
Tell me, do you feel the same?

Je ne sais quoi, I know you have a special something
Je ne sais quoi, oh, something I just can't explain
And when I see your face I wanna follow my emotions
Je ne sais pas, pourquoi?

I just love this crazy feeling

Eastern European Funk,"You’ve seen it all before
We ain’t got no taste we’re all a bore

We survived the reds and 2 world wars

Get up and dance to our Eastern European kinda…
Get up and dance to our Eastern European kinda…

Yes Sir, we are legal we are, though we are not as legal as you
No Sir we’re not equal no, though we are both from the EU
We build your homes and wash your dishes
Keep you your hands all soft and clean
But one of these days you’ll realize Eastern Europe is in your genes

Apricot Stone,"Many, many years ago
When I was a little child
Mama told me you should know
Our world is cruel and wild
But to make your way through cold and heat
Love is all that you need

I believed her every word
More than anything I heard
But I was too scared to lose my fun
I began to cry a lot
And she gave me apricots
Kisses of the earth, fruits of the sun

Apricot stone
Hidden in my hand
Given back to me
From the motherland

Apricot stone
I will drop it down
In the frozen ground
Let it, let it make its round

Apricot stone
Hidden in my hand
Given back to me
From the motherland

Apricot Stone

Now I see the Northern stars
Shining brightly in the storm
And I've got an avatar
Of my love to keep me warm
Now I'm not afraid of violent winds
They may blow - they can't win

May the winter stay away
From my harvest night and day
May God bless and keep my cherished fruit
Grow my tree up to the sky
Once I waved my home goodbye
I just want to go back to my roots

Apricot stone
Hidden in my hand
Given back to me
From the motherland

Apricot stone
I will drop it down
In the frozen ground
Let it, let it make its round

Apricot stone
Hidden in my hand
Given back to me
From the motherland

Apricot stone
Hidden in my hand
Given back to me
From the motherland

Apricot Stone"
Milim (מילים),"Again, the sadness is here, again the fear arose
And the end is woven in my window
A cracked glass and again silence
Exhausted and thrown, in my mind
The light is asleep and tears of blood
are burning in my throat
A scratched door handle, a falling ceiling
When I sing this last song to you You left me only words,
A shelter in the shadows
Organized books and among the rooms
You left me only words
A bouquet of locks
My God,
You left me only words The walls are silent now
And what did you take when you ran away,
Yes, what did you take?
In this war you may have won
And what was left for me when you left? You left me only words,
A shelter in the shadows
Organized books and among the rooms
You left me only words
A bouquet of locks
My God, you left me only words Even the ice gets cold when I remember
How today you are across from him
Lit by his shadow, fall apart for him
The words you left me
You are now saying to him"
In a Moment Like This,"For as long as I remember, for as long as I’ve been blue
Everyday since we’ve been parted all I’ve thought about was you
Didn’t need the time for sorrow, didn’t need the time for pain
What am I supposed to do when living without you was the worst I ever knew?

In a moment like this
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what you’re looking for
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know could you ask for more
Oh, in a moment like this
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what I have to do
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know how to get to you
Oh, in a moment like this

Ever since the day you left me, ever since you went away
I’m lost and I don’t know where am I supposed to go, I still miss you so

In a moment like this
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what you’re looking for
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know could you ask for more
Oh, in a moment like this

When I need you, hold me, say you’ll love and never leave me
My heart will forever be true

In a moment like this
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what you’re looking for
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know could you ask for more
Oh, in a moment like this
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what I have to do
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know how to get to you
Oh, in a moment like this"
Il pleut de l'or,"At the horizon, a touch of silver
Like after a storm, drifting clouds
At summer nights, forgotten dreams
Thanks to your perfume, I’ve found my way It’s raining gold, whenever you talk about love
It’s raining gold
It’s raining gold, let’s start a big journey
Under the starry sky, the destinies are golden
It’s raining gold And in the morning, our secret
Exchanged glances, accomplice of summer
The day hunting for magic
Eyes still shining It’s raining gold, whenever you talk about love
It’s raining gold
It’s raining gold, let’s start a big journey
Under the starry sky, the destinies are golden
It’s raining gold, all night until the dawn
It’s raining gold Dance with me, fly with me
Speak softly, speak to me It’s raining gold
It’s raining gold
It’s raining gold, let’s start a big journey
Under the starry sky, the destinies are golden
It’s raining gold, all night until the dawn
It’s raining gold"
This Is My Life,"[Verse 1]
I go down the beating track
Along the river with an empty bag
At the end, she said to me
Why are you here
With the autumn leaves?

'Cause this is my life, my friend
And this is my time to stand
And this is my life, my friend
And I can't be no one else

Strike an iron and untuck my soul
Misty moon you're gonna see
I've got your blues to get on my feet

Drip Drop,"You are my man
You are my half

I can tell when you lie
I can tell you stopped trying

And these last three weeks passed and we barely talk
I think I know and it's breaking my heart
Am I in or am I out?

Can I love you forever through this?
Can I trust in you forever through this?

How to stop
These tear drops
That drip drop, drip drop
Drip drop, drip drop
These tear drops

Why are you late?
You smell like lipstick, again

Can I trust in you forever through this?

How to stop

I don't wanna hear your name
If this is how it is
I don't wanna run
Run away from myself
And be lost again

Oh no no no, oh no no no

Rock is the king of fun, sharp but genuine
Hot like summer, colourful like autumn But just a drop of imagination
And the polka hides behind a harsher rhythm Let there (let there, let there) be a shift in the mind
Let there (let there, let there) be a positive shock
The feeling is right, let everyone get swept by

Patriotic sense, love and pride

Spreads energy throughout the land like fire But just a little bit of imagination

Oh… oh…
Oh… oh…
You’re an angel born to be free
But I’ve got you and you’ve got me
When the lights go down, you bring me salvation
When the tears run dry, you appear
To save and love and comfort me
Till the end of time you will always be my angel
My love, my love
You’re an angel, my love
Oh… oh…
Oh… oh…
You’re an angel, don’t you believe?
An angel predicted your way
You’re an angel, did you forget?
Your love proves it

Life Looks Better in Spring,"Time changes everything
Even you and I have changed
The rain the winters bring
Has made us fade away

I still remember everything -
That old December, the fears, the cold
I really wonder how you feel
On these nights, so alone

I hope someday you'll see me
I hope someday you'll spot me in the crowd
Take my hand and kiss me
I hope someday you'll say my name out loud

Tell me, tell me about your feelings
Tell me about your stories
Look into my eyes and come on closer
Make me immortal with a kiss

Tell me, tell me about your feelings
Tell me about your stories
We know it's over, so tell me it's over
And life will be better in spring

Time changes everything
But this feeling it still remains
The sweetest ever lips I kissed
Will always be the same

I hope someday you'll see me
I hope someday you'll spot me in the crowd
Smile and say you miss me
I hope someday you'll say my name out loud

Tell me, tell me about your feelings
Tell me about your stories
Look into my eyes and come on closer
Make me immortal with a kiss

Tell me, tell me about your feelings
Tell me about your stories
We know it's over, so tell me it's over
And life will be better in spring

Tell me, tell me about your feelings
Tell me about your stories
Look into my eyes and come on closer
Make me immortal with a kiss

Tell me, tell me about your feelings
Tell me about your stories
We know it's over, so tell me it's over
And life will be better in spring"
Lako je sve,"Everything, everything is easy
Every time I'm with you
Trust me, wherever I am,
I'm yours, know it
The shine in my eyes is telling you that Everything, everything is easy
Because you're not leaving me
When I don't smile to you,
Know that I sin
I'm just a woman
Who lets her feelings have her With my last strenght I'm standing
Here in front of you
Barrel of disturbance is harrowing my soul
It's harder for me to
Work this pain out
Because you're deceived
And it's killing me Everything, everything is easy
Because you know me the best
While I'm standing in front of you,
You can see that I'm scared
Because on my face
It's written ""betrayal"" Everything, everything is easy
Because you know me the best
Please, forgive me
I love you
I really love you
Without you
I don't know, that's not me any more That's not me any more Trust me, wherever I am,
I'm yours, know it
The shine in my eyes is telling you that
Everything, everything is easy"
Shine,"[Verse 1]
Who can ever tell the colour of our soul
And the memories we keep from long ago?
Do we ever really know each other's past?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You can't go back to before
But tomorrow will bring even more

[Chorus]
Like the tide's gonna turn you will know
When it's cold
You're on your own but you're never alone
Shine, shine like the stars in the sky
Wipe the dust off your love, let it shine

[Verse 2]
So when nothing's really ever carved in stone
Remember that your heart is holding on
And when every second melts up in the past

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't be afraid it will end
Only fear that it never began

[Chorus]
Like the tide's gonna turn you will know
When it's cold
You're on your own but you're never alone
Shine, shine like the stars in the sky
Wipe the dust off your love, let it shine
Oh...

[Bridge]
You can't go back to before
But tomorrow will bring even more…

[Chorus]
When it's cold
You're on your own but you're never alone (never alone)
Shine, shine like the stars in the sky
Wipe the dust off your love, let it shine

When it's cold
You're on your own but you're never alone
Shine, shine like the stars in the sky
Wipe the dust off your love, let it shine

[Outro]
Let it shine.."
We Could Be the Same,"You could be the one in my dreams
You could be much more than you seem
Anything I wanted in life
Do you understand what I mean?

I can see that this could be fate
I can love you more than they hate
Doesn't matter who they will blame
We can beat them at their own game

I can see it in your eyes
It doesn't come as a surprise
I see you dancing like a star
No matter how different we are

For all this time I've been loving you
Don't even know your name
For just one night, we could be the same
No matter what they say

And I feel I'm turning the page
And I feel the world is a stage
I don't think that drama will stop
I don't think they'll give up the rage

But I know the world could be great
I can love you more than they hate
Doesn't matter who they will blame
We can beat them at their own game

I can see it in your eyes
It doesn't come as a surprise
I see you dancing like a star
No matter how different we are

For all this time I've been loving you
Don't even know your name
For just one night, we could be the same
No matter what they say

For all this time I've been loving you
Don't even know your name
For just one night, we could be the same
No matter what they say
No matter what they say

No matter what they say (they say they say)
We could be the same
No matter what they say"
Algo pequeñito,"Something tiny, something very small
A white rose, a touch, a sweet kiss and a forgiveness
Something tiny, something very small
A tender gesture, a glance, a hug or a flower
Something tiny, something very small
A simple I love you, full of sweetness, fondness and passion,
is what I’m asking from you, my love, my life is falling apart, you’re breaking my heart
Try to change soon, there is really no more time
Something tiny,
Something very small,
Simple things, that you’re not giving to me anymore,
I’m desperately asking you for them, if you don’t want this to end
Something tiny,
Something very small,
In your hands you’re holding the chance
Today you decide whether you want me or you want to break my heart
Something tiny, something very nice
Your hair in the wind that gets entangled between my hands with heat
You used to know that small things are what makes it burn
Now try to change and other things will be arranged
Something tiny,
Something very small,
Simple things, give me now
Cause I love you madly and I always will
Something tiny,
Something very small,
In your hands you’re holding the chance
You’ve decided to love me and not to break my heart
And not break my heart
Something tiny,
Something very small,
Simple things, that you’re not giving to me anymore,
I’m desperately asking you for them, if you don’t want this to end
Something tiny,
Something very small,
In your hands you’re holding the chance
Today you decide whether you want me or you want to break my heart"
My Heart Is Yours,"You are like a sunset behind a mountain somewhere
And when I cannot see you I know you're still there

Because my heart is yours, I'll never leave you
Though we are far apart I'm by your side
My love is never gone, I feel it rise again
Through it all, now my heart is yours

You say I am the moonlight, I watch you at night
And when you cannot see me I'm still there in the sky

Because my heart is yours, I'll never leave you
Though we are far apart I'm by your side
My love is never gone, I feel it rise again
Through it all, now my heart is yours

Because my heart is yours, I'll never leave you
Though we are far apart I'm by your side
My love is never gone, I feel it rise again
Through it all, now my heart is yours"
That Sounds Good to Me,"How do I begin to imagine
All the happy faces I'd like to see?
The final destination, the sounds of celebration
If I could find the opportunity
So I wonder, who can I turn to?
Who can make these wishes and dreams come true?
And with you there beside me
Loving hands to guide me, anything is possible to do
So if you bring the sunshine, I'll bring the good times
Just add your laughter, it's happy ever after
I don't know about you but that sounds good to me
I can feel it coming together
All the love been working so very well
There's nothing left to do now
Gonna see it through now"

Satellite,"[Verse 1]
I went everywhere for you
I even did my hair for you
I bought new underwear, they're blue
And I wore 'em just the other day
Love, you know I'd fight for you
I left on the porch light for you
Whether you are sweet or cruel
I'm gonna love you either way

[Chorus]
Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love
Like a satellite, I'm in an orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your love

[Verse 2]
Love, I got it bad for you
I saved the best I have for you
You sometimes make me sad and blue
Wouldn't have it any other way
Love, my aim is straight and true
Cupid's arrow is just for you
I even painted my toenails for you
I did it just the other day

[Chorus]
Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love
Like a satellite, I'm in an orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your
Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love

[Bridge]
Where you go, I follow
You set the pace, we take it fast or slow
I follow in your wake
Oh, oh, oh
You got me, you got me
A force more powerful than gravity
It's physics, there's no escape

[Pre-Chorus]
Love, my aim is straight and true
Cupid's arrow is just for you
I even painted my toenails for you
I did it just the other day

[Chorus]
Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love
Like a satellite, I'm in an orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your love
Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love

Love, oh, love
Love, love, love"
Jestem,"I am, I am I am in your words, thoughts, every gesture of yours
I am like the water, the earth, the fire and the air
I am - you're melting like ice in my arms You're waiting at least for each smile, each word
Every day you try to get me again
I got used to you And when I have some problem
You'll be the first at my door
Now, finally, I am certain
That you'll send me flowers everyday I am your inspiration, a solace for your tears
(Your world revolves around me)
You are my shadow at every nod
(You appear by my side,
You jump into the fire whenever I want) I feel how anxiety overcomes you again and again
Like a deck of cards I discover you gradually
With you, I forget And when the night lulls us to sleep
My thoughts run wild to your eyes, to your lips
To make sure that still, yet..."
Haba Haba,"When as a little girl my grandma told me
That I could be just anything that I wanted to
When as a little girl my grandma told me
That I could be just anything that I wanted to
She said that: Everything I work for, everything I wish for
Everything I look for it is right in front of me
Everything I work for, everything I wish for
Everything I look for it is right in front of me
And she said:
Haba Haba, hujaza kibaba - Haba Haba, hujaza kibaba
Haba Haba, hujaza kibaba - Haba Haba, hujaza kibaba
When as a little girl my grandma told me
That it's the little things in life that's gonna make me happy
When as a little girl my grandma told me
That it's the little things in life that's gonna make me happy
She said that: Little by little, fills up the measure
Don't ever give up, keep on moving
Little by little, fills up the measure
Don't ever give up, keep on moving
Haba Haba, hujaza kibaba - Haba Haba, hujaza kibaba
Haba Haba, hujaza kibaba - Haba Haba, hujaza kibaba

Feel the Passion (Kënga ime),"Feel my heart, feel the words beat low
I sing my song and the echo flows
And wherever I go, I just want you to know
You're the blood in my veins and the love in my soul
You are my wave rippling over sea
You dry my tears and you make me grieve
But wherever I go, I just want you to know
My moment in time, oh sweet song of mine, eh...

I'm like an eagle in the open sky
I'll never land, I'm flying high

Let me share my song with you, just feel the passion
Love's the message shining through, a chain reaction
It brings my heaven down to earth and this is why
It drives me mad but it gives me life, I'm free to fly, eh...

And when I feel that I thirst for you
I dab my lips with your morning dew
But wherever I go, I just want you to know
Sweet song, live forever and I'll live with you, eh...

I'll never land, I'm flying high

It drives me mad but it gives me life, I'm free to fly, eh...

Live It Up,"Here's your favourite song on the radio
Shake your head to the beat- it's rock n roll
If you're feeling the world has kicked you down
All you need is just to have a little fun

Hey, it's time to live it up
My friend, put the record on
Sing it loud and let it out
Life is beautiful
My friend let it out
Life is beautiful

Give yourself a break, come on and live it up
Give yourself a break

Driving on with no map to lead me on
Eyes on the horizon and there's no turning round
Sometimes i feel, i feel i'm not alone
So let your colors shine right next to mine

Hey, it's time to live it up
My friend, put the record on
Sing it loud and let it out
Life is beautiful
My friend let it out
Life is beautiful

Give yourself a break, come on and live it up
Give yourself a break

I say my friend life is beautiful
I say my friend life is beautiful

I say my friend¦ put the record on
Sing it loud and let it out
Life is beautiful
My friend let it out
Life is beautiful

Give yourself a break, come on and live it up

Čaroban (Чаробан),"It's freezing and everywhere there's slippery ice
I really had a bad day
The people are weird, no one has any manners
I'm tired and dragging myself home And while I'm digging through my purse, looking for my key
I'm already losing my nerves
It's my sun, my moon and all my stars
It's my man is opening the door
It's my man is at the door And at the same time I feel like I have the worth of a thousand woman
Because he thinks I'm pretty and strong as a rock
And when he hugs me, I know everything is all right
That man is magical He turns all my darkness into spring
Since he loves me, I stand tall
And I'm good enough for him, just the way I am
That man is magical I say goodbye to my sorrow and hello to my smile
Alongside him happiness has moved in
He's so warm, gentle and beautifully himself
He only belongs to me We have long talks, he's my best friend
With him I laugh like crazy
People tell me that they haven't seen
A couple that radiates that much
Our love is contagious Now I know that I have the worth of a thousand woman
Because he thinks I'm pretty and strong as a rock
And when he hugs me, I know everything is all right
That man is magical He turns all my darkness into spring
Since he loves me, I stand tall
And I'm good enough for him, just the way I am
That man is magical"
Get You,"I choose my words like wise men do
And tonight I'll get you right
I rule my world like great men do
And I fight, I fight for mine

And you look so good on the floor
Pull my mind in that dirty zone
If they watch, let them watch
Not losing you tonight

Oh oh... I'm coming to get you
Oh oh... I'm running, I'm coming for you
Oh oh... I'm gonna get you
I know you, you want me too

I lost my mind somewhere between
Your face and your perfect shape
I found a pleasure watching you having fun
Fooling around

And you look so good on the floor
Pull my mind in that dirty zone
If they talk, let them talk
You know I'm getting you tonight

Oh oh... I'm coming to get you
Oh oh... I'm running, I'm coming for you

In Love for a While,"I looked into your eyes, and when I saw your smile
I knew right from the start, life is good for a while
Romance comes and goes but a love like ours is here to stay
Each lovely night and sunny day

I love everything about you, I couldn't do without you
Whenever you're near me, all my days are on the bright side
But when I'm not around you, I have to find the way
To be with you each night and every day

Nananana...

And as time goes by and we've seen stormy weather
I know that you and I, we're always getting better
But when I'm not around you, I have to find the way
To be with you each night and every day

Oh, I couldn't do without you, yeah
I have to find the way to...
To be with you, no oh no no oh...
I love everything you do
I have to find the way to be with you

I know you and I are in love for a while"
One More Day,"After the day I met you there I am not the same
I try to sleep but nothing helps me feel insane
Passion game that I play gonna last one more day
One more night I'll be there in my dreams again and again

I wanna give it on fire, uncover vicious desire
Abandon painful denial, find every reason to stay
One more forbidden sensation, one more emotional flare
Down with the fake hesitation, hell yeah, I'm ready to pay

Pay for the hopeless despair
Gonna live one more day of my fate

Here I am standing with my determination
I remember when I used to be one of those silly fellows, kind of ""really don't care""
And I realized all my thoughts and all my fears around me
You wanted to know what I felt and you got it right there

Turn around, all the words of regrets
And seize the chance to find the way so I can be raised
I am too lame, psycho from the brain
There is nothing I can do, that's a part of the game

Out of such foolish state gonna find no other way
(Make way, 'cause it's all about the shame)
Feel no shame, 'cause I live one more day again

I wanna give it to fire, uncover vicious desire
Abandon painful denial, find every reason to stay
One more forbidden sensation, one more emotional flare
Down with the fake hesitation, hell yeah, I'm ready to pay

Pay for the hopeless despair
(Turn back in the days when you desired and craved)
(And all the way you felt just like burned in the flame)
Gonna live one more day of my fate
(No shame, no way, no play, no brain, no game)

I wanna give it to fire, uncover vicious desire
Abandon painful denial, find every reason to stay
One more forbidden sensation, one more emotional flare
Down with the fake hesitation, hell yeah, I'm ready to pay

Pay for the hopeless despair
Gonna live one more day of my fate"
Da Da Dam,"Peter is smart, he knows each European country by heart*
He likes to sit under an apple tree on his yard
And wait for an apple to fall
When Peter is nine, his teacher tells him that this planet is dying
That someone needs to put an end to it all
And so when Peter comes home, he tells his mom:
I’m going out in the world to save our planet
And I ain’t coming back until she’s saved
I’ll walk my way to see the king and parliament
If they don’t help, I’ll do it by myself
I don’t wanna be…
Dadadam dadadam dadadada dadada…
Peter is young, he tries to talk, but no one listens to him
Everybody’s busy living and dying, not thinking about what they’re doing
But look at the boy who went out in the world to save our planet
And he ain’t coming back until she’s saved
He walked his way to see the king and parliament
But they all turned their heads and walked away, singing:
Dadadam dadadam dadadada dada…
Dadadam dadadam dadadada dada…
And now I’m going out in the world to save our planet
And I ain’t coming back until she’s saved
I’m walking in the footsteps that young Peter made
And everybody is welcome to join, and sing with me:
Dadadam dadadam dadadada dada dadam…
Dadadam dadadam dadadada dada dadam…
Dadadam dadadam dadadada dada dadam…"
One Life,"Life's a game, it's a mystery
Which we give in to
Days go by, no lesson learned
Just things that you do

Things change even in my mind
And not in my heart
I am who I am and I'm here for you

One life - show what's in your heart
Love me like I love you
One life - it's all we got to live
Time to set your heart free

Chase the pain away
And move on and don't give up
This time it's all up to you
You can love yourself too

Life is strange and heavenly
Sweet surrender (Surrender)
Love begins within ourselves
Makes up our lives

Hold on to what life brings you
Just be who you are
You can do it too

One life - show what's in your heart
Love me like I love you
One life - it's all we got to live

You don't know how I feel
Love me, love me for who I am
My life, I will give it all
I give it all to you, give it all

One life - show what's in your heart
Love me like I love you
One life - it's all we got to live
Time to set your heart free

Chase the pain away
Move on and don't give up

Stand By,"Oh, the sea: waves of eternity, waves of serenity
As I stare through them, all around me just dies
Tonight, can we pretend there's no more time?
Let's lock our doors and leave this endless world outside

But if you don't mind, I will be here
Holding back those years that pass us by
And in a natural high you'll hold my hand, we'll take a breath
So tonight, if you don't mind, I will stand by

Oh, this life, something so beautiful but hard at the same time
Taught me it could be gone in a blink of an eye
Tonight, can we pretend there's no more time?
Let's lock our doors and leave this endless world outside

If you don't mind, I will be here
Holding back those years that pass us by
And in a natural high you'll hold my hand, we'll take a breath
So tonight, if you don't mind, I will stand by

(I will be here) Holding back, holding back
(Those years that pass us by)
And in a natural high you'll hold my hand, we'll take a breath
So tonight, if you don't mind, I will stand by"
Celebrate,"Friday, my night
Flashing street lights
Let's get this old town dancing
Leave the troubles behind, oh...

Put your hands up
Let the magic take over your heart
Join us, you'll have a good time

Celebrate every single step you take

Coming Home,"Some say I'm a bit of a fool
Sitting on a hill and counting raindrops
Keep thinking I just wanna go
To the peaceful place I know that I call home

But oh oh oh it's time to go
I'll see you, I'll see you soon

'Cause I can't wait for tomorrow
To say the things I wanna say
Your smile will always lead my way
I can't wait, I'm coming soon
I just wanna see your face again

Some say I'm a bit of a fool
Driving down the road I stop to listen
I hear your laughter in the trees
Your whisper in the breeze: ""My love is you""

But oh oh oh it's time to go
I'll see you, I'll see you soon

'Cause I can't wait for tomorrow
To say the things I wanna say
Your smile will always lead my way
I can't wait, I'm coming soon
I just wanna see your face again

'Cause no one knows his where or when
When my time on earth comes to an end
Then I'll find you
And I know that you will be my love again

I can't wait for tomorrow
To say the things I wanna say
Your smile will always lead my way
I can't wait, I'm coming soon
I just wanna see your face again

'Cause I can't wait for tomorrow
To say the things I wanna say
Your smile will always lead my way
I can't wait, I'm coming home to you
I just wanna see your face again
I'm coming home"

What is mine in this life? Just the heaven and sea
No, I won't give them up, they're my fortune, my proof
Don't believe what you hear 'cause the truth kills your truth
The duty I've got is my war against fear
And I want you with me, yes, I want you so near

The language of my body, the sound my heart makes
So I'm staying alive and my losses won't let
My soul to surrender, the power of loss is my bet

Multiplied by you
It all looks great
It all looks cool

Healthy children
Go to school

My son loves too

Oh, on the surface...
Oh, in the distance...
It's all the same

Oh, in the darkness...
Oh, don't you notice
What a different game?

[Hook]
If you take this life from me today
Tear it up and bury me away
You'll just find two, three songs of mine
Hundred worries of mine

Your love, your love in rewind
You'll just find two, three songs of mine
Hundred more reasons why
And all your love in rewind

Sito, sito, sito, sito

One to hundred
Multiplied by two
It's less about me
It's less about you

You keep it running
On certainty, but don't know
Where to run from reality

The Secret Is Love,"When I close my eyes, I fall into a dream
Can’t you see this world of people, live in peace
The sun is shining in my heart, rainbows in the sky
Spread your wings and fly, fly, fly, high
We’re gonna dream us on our way in a world where we are not meant to stay
Together we can make it, oh, the secret is you, it’s love
When I smile inside my heart, I feel so free
All the fears and doubts they turn into belief
I feel right, we’ll make it right, now
If we trust, trust, trust in love
We’re gonna dream us on our way in a world where we’re not meant to stay
Together we can make it, oh, the secret is love
I’m reaching out my hand to you
So, just let the light shine through
So we can realise the wonder of love, trust, love, life
So I want to believe
So I want what it takes, to see – love
Just open your eyes
We’re gonna dream us on our way in a world where we’re not meant to stay
Together we can make it, oh, the secret is love
I’m reaching out my hand to you
So, just let the light shine through (the light shine through)
So we can realise the wonder of love, trust, love, life
Spread your wings and fly
Trust, love
The secret is love"
Never Alone,"Awake your heart
You fear it, but we'll make a start
Seems like the wind just blows your way
With clouds full of rain

And you hide
Because the world ain't right
Know that your cold and hurtin' soul
Is never alone

Don't waste your time, just lift your mind
Imagination comes alive
Now you know that I'll be by your side

Feel the risin' hope and the sky will open
Take my hand, don't stall, have faith
Though the road is long, there are golden gardens
At the sweet end of your trail

Lay down now
I'll ease your heart, erase your frown
To light up the darkness in your dreams
I will be here

And we'll find
The freedom you left behind
Capture the sun, the source, it shone
You were never alone

Don't waste your time, just lift your mind
Imagination comes alive
Now you know that I'll be by your side

Feel the risin' hope and the sky will open
Take my hand, don't stall, have faith
Though the road is long, there are golden gardens
At the sweet end of your trail

Though the road is long, there are golden gardens
At the sweet end of your trail
At the sweet end of your trail"

I'm Still Alive,"Now nothing can touch me

Lonely I've walked through the fire
But I'm Still Alive

Now nothing can touch me
I've seen what I can be
Lonely I've walked through the fire
I'm Still Alive

Would ya climb up the mountain
Would ya battle the ocean
Would ya give just to loose it all
I've been living my life and
Try to learn ever lesson
Now I see why I fight and I fall

PRE When the roads not to wide
Then trust the heart never lies

Now nothing can touch me
I've seen what I can be
Lonely I've walked through the fire
But I'm Still Alive
I'm Still Alive

If ya lost all the meanin
No more truth to believe in
Would the light inside fade to grey
But if ya shine like a diamond
Don't get caught in the moment
Never letting your breath slip away

PRE When the roads not to wide
Then trust the heart never lies

Now nothing can touch me
I've seen what I can be
Lonely I've walked through the fire
But I'm Still Alive
I'm Still Alive"

World becomes a better place
And you know deep inside
Love is taking all the space

We are birds, we fly so high and we are falling down

We are people of the planet, we live human lives
We are angels, we're in danger, we are crystal white, crystal white

When you look into my eyes
Sun is touching mountain top
When you look into my eyes
It will never have to stop
Baby, I love you... and you?

We are birds, we fly so high and we are falling down
When I dream of you, my dream is so fearless
We are people of the planet, we live human lives

Martini
Whiskey on the rocks

Love traded in for lust
It's emotions I don't trust

On top
The cream of the crop

You see
It's all about me
The servants and the king
I'm the ruler of the world

A tug
She pulls me like a drug
I want her on the rug
But she's not that kind of girl

I see you where the lights glow
You pull me in your private side show
And now I see your moves in slowmo
I try to kiss you, but you slip away

Yet you never walk away from me
Are you a shadow of what might be?
Why should one woman stand above the rest?
There is a mystery to you deep beneath the flesh!

Those eyes pulling me in
A body made to sin
But I can not win

Wait
I'm ready at the gate
Don't tell me it's too late
Her fire starts to melt my heart

She's clean
Not part of any scene
She's more like a dream
I don't want to wake up from!

I see
She's somehow changing me
She's where I want to be
Can't stand a moment without her
Anymore!

I see you where the lights glow
You pull me in your private side show
And now I see your moves in slowmo
I try to kiss you, but you slip away

Yet you never walk away from me
Are you a shadow of what might be?
Why should one woman stand above the rest?
There is a mystery to you deep beneath the flesh!"

San aggelos s'agapisa (Σαν άγγελος σ'αγάπησα),"I walk alone in my lonely sanctuaries,
The road is long and wherever you guide me, I will go
You crucified me, you made me bleed even when I was dying for you
My tears were flowing like blood, forgotten words. I thought that angels live in our dreams,
But I believed in lies, they live among us
A desolate heart since you left me
Come back again, I’m waiting for you, my star and my happiness To the garden of our love, I went to look for you,
But you got lost in the crowd, I could not cry
The crossroads of soul and our secret supper
Lost in your path, the cycle is now closed. I loved you like an angel, come back into my arms,
Tell me one more time that you love me, redeem my heart
I loved you like an angel, come into my arms,
Come again and guide my wilderness to the light. I loved you like an angel"

I Love Belarus,"Hey yeah yeah yeah...
Hey yeah yeah yeah...
Hey yeah yeah yeah...
Hey yeah yeah yeah...

I'm feeling great and it's easy to be strong
When all the hearts keep on beating as one
The sky is blue and I'm writing a new song
Saying that I'm free, friendly and young

I have so much and I'm ready to show you
Let's come together, so here is my hand
We're gonna fly watching lakes in their full view
Fields are full of gold, and it's all my land

I love Belarus, got it deep inside
I love Belarus, feel it in my mind
And I wanna see the sun shining from above
You will always be the one, I can't get enough

I love Belarus, got it deep inside
I love Belarus, feel it in my mind
And I wanna see the sun shining from above
And I'm gonna every day give you all my love

So here I go and I'm ready to rise up
Just like a star guiding me through the night
I've got no fear and I will never give up
Love is all we need and it's our light

I love Belarus, got it deep inside
I love Belarus, feel it in my mind
And I wanna see the sun shining from above
You will always be the one, I can't get enough

I love Belarus, got it deep inside
I love Belarus, feel it in my mind
And I wanna see the sun shining from above
And I'm gonna every day give you all my love

Time will not erase courage and my grace
I'm stronger every day, I say...
(I love Belarus, I love Belarus)
You will always be the one, I can't get enough

I love Belarus, got it deep inside
I love Belarus, feel it in my mind
And I wanna see the sun shining from above
And I'm gonna every day give you all my love

I love Belarus"

Come on boys, come on girls
In this crazy, crazy world
You're the diamonds, you're the pearls
Let's make a new tomorrow today

[Verse 1]
Wake up, slow down, do nothing right now
Breathe in, breathe out, did we forget how
To live to dream and what it all means

Tonight, tomorrow you're out of time
Upstyle, you are back in the line
A race to nowhere

Lipstick,"You say you’re on it but you just don’t know

Sognu,"I dream of those lips,
of this clear and pure voice.
A memory never lost within me.
That night here with you. I dream, I wail.
In my heart there is no spring.
Of life I expect tomorrow.
Kneeling I guard the sea! I will share the world with you,
but you don't want to.
I dream of a victory.
I always think that, far away from you.
You are close to me, I dream of you. I will sing, I will sing to you, the song of you and me. I cry and feel bad.
I pray to the heaven till I die.
Here on the mountain, I'd be in front of you
to awaken from this dream. If you die, I will stop living."
Madness of Love (Follia d'amore),"Saying yes, saying never
Is not easy, you know
When all of us are in the orbit of madness
I no longer know who you are
It doesn't even matter who you are
For me it's enough to miss the charm of the nostalgia And in another fragile dream you'll see another me
You'll laugh as if
I had never loved you
You'll search for another me
Beyond the shadow of a coffee
You'll find only me
If I stop for a moment I don't know who you are That's how we live around here
Day by day
Night by night
Meanwhile the world turns away from its poetry Don't ever portray me, don't ever force me
Let's lose ourselves in the threshold of my madness But you'll see another me, a fragile, a disarmed one
Because what you are
Will never change,no
Even if I were you
As the time I'd run out
So, stay with me
I don't lose the sight of you, not even for a moment And you'll see another you
Almost invincible
Alive as never before
And that's when you'll have me
Over the false spells, you'll be the sky
And you'll shine
You'll shine
You'll shine
You'll shine"
I Can,"You were the eyes in the face of fortune
I lost my way and I couldn't find you
Oh, oh no

We're not the first ones to be divided
Won't be the last to be reunited

It's like tears falling down
Drops of pain hit the ground
I can't speak
There's no sound when you're gone

I can untie these hands
And get back up again

I have never lost anything quite like this
No second chances if I don't find it
No (no)
Oh no
(oh no)

You closed the door and you kept on walking
Left me behind and there's no more talking
No
Oh no
(Oh no)

It's like tears falling down
Drops of pain hit the ground

I can't speak
There's no sound when you're gone

When you're gone

I can untie these hands
And get back up again

Taken by a Stranger,"[Verse 1]
She's got a knuckle in her eye
He knows her cat call
Can't escape from telling lies
I heard her sayin':
""Hey, mind if I take this chair?""
""Hey, mind if I take this chair?""
He drops a pause
She looks annoyed
But she's so mean
He thinks she has to be the one

[Chorus]
Taken by a stranger
Stranger things are starting to begin
Lured into the danger
Trip me up and spin me 'round again

[Verse 2]
You've got some coffee on your collar
And you forgot to comb your hair
But I can wait 'til I do better
You're here and I don't care
Can't help it if you like it
'Cause I won't be here tomorrow
No one ever told you that you wouldn't be rejected

[Chorus]
Taken by a stranger
Stranger things are starting to begin
Lured into the danger (It's a risky business)
Trip me up and spin me round again

[Bridge]
Da da da da, da da da
Da da da da, da da da
Uhhhh
Na na na na na

[Verse 3]
Put the blindfold on his eyes
She saw him, peek through
Can't imagine her disguise
I heard her sayin':
""Hey, mind if I take this chair?""
""Yeah, see if I care""

[Chorus]
Taken by a stranger
Stranger things are starting to begin
Lured into the danger (It's a risky business)
Trip me up and spin me round again"

because I'm not dreaming, this is reality.
I feel like I'm living in a cloud, I've got what I never had before.
I've got you, you, and everything you give me. And even though I know very well

I know, that at the end of the story
I will have enjoyed it.
Especially what's happening right now. Ouo uo oo, ouo uo oo

Never Forget,"Shes singing softly in the night
Praying for the morning light
She dreams of how they used to be
At dawn they will be free

Memories they haunt his mind
Save him from the endless night
She whispers warm and tenderly
Please come back to me

And when the golden sun arises far across the sea
The dawn will break as darkness fades forever well be free

Never forget what I did, what I said
When I gave you all my heart and soul
Morning will come and I know well be one
Cause I still believe that youll remember me

She mourns beneath the moonlit sky
Remembering when they said goodbye
Wheres the one he used to know
It seems so long ago

And when the golden sun arises far across the sea
The dawn will break as darkness fades forever well be free

Never forget what I did, what I said
When I gave you all my heart and soul
Morning will come and I know well be one
Cause I still believe that youll remember me

Never forget what I did, what I said
When I gave you all my heart and soul
Morning will come and I know well be one
Cause I still believe that youll remember me

Oh I still believe that youll remember me
Oh I still believe that youll remember me"

Beautiful Song,"I was born in distant 1980
The year that Irish Johnny Logan won
Thirty years ago, they still remember
So dream away
Today's the day
I'm singing out my song

When I join this grand parade of winners
And we've made this song a worldwide hit
I will buy oh my own mike to sing in
And all the jobs I've had before I'm surely gonna quit

Beautiful song is on the radio, is in the tv shows and so on and on
Beautiful song that everybody hums and everybody loves

Beautiful song is on the radio, is in the tv shows and so on and on
Beautiful song that everybody hums and everybody loves

My Mom said I'd grow up to be a singer
And Daddy smiled when gave me my guitar
I do my best, and I'll be so much better
Brightest of the highest and the farthest of the stars

And on that day when Sir Mick Jagger phones me
Tell him, please, that I am very busy
Writing brand new songs with Paul McCartney
So sorry Mick, I'll call you back, someday I'll call you back...

Beautiful song is on the radio, is in the tv shows and so on and on
Beautiful song that everybody hums and everybody loves"
Suus,"Hmm, in this world,
Where love does not exist anymore
Time has no time for us
No-o
No-o-o-o-o...
Time has no time for us.

I land my plane
On lightless runway of your soul
Elbow their way through today
Those who yesterday couldn't live
But yesterdays have no significance
From the turbulent seas were swallowed up
Hmmm, tomorrows won’t bring anything
Besides hopeless hope and insanity

So just let me cry, cry, cry
'cause this is what I do best now!
'cause this is what I do best now."
Zaleilah,"Mandinga everyday

Would You?,"Come and find me, Ive been hiding from you
Come and get me, running from you
Its been easy, easy for you to believe me
When I say I love you
But what would you do when my house was empty?
My life in a bag and away from you
You took my love for granted, would you really miss me?
Any other guy would do, but would you?
Its a secret and a question for you
Where are they now? What are you gonna do?
If you run here and wait for me now, are we done here?
Or starting somehow?
But what would you do when my house was empty?
My life in a bag and away from you
You took my love for granted, would you really miss me?
Any other guy would do, but would you? Would you?
Its a two-way street
And I know that
But dont look back
Still I wonder, still I wonder
But what would you do when my house was empty?
My life in a bag just to be with you
But when Im at your door will you say you miss me?
Any other guy would do
Yeah, other guy would do, but would you?
But would you?
Oh would you?
I love you"
När jag blundar,"Close to each other, the scent of us two
Turns around, the same shirt but blue
The scent I sense would be nothing without you
Like an ocean without water,
like a lantern without light A life without colours, that's not you
Someone you see when you close your eyes
like an angel before you
Someone who helps you
fly when you've forgot how to do it Beloved without feelings or laughter without sound
A life without colours, that's not you
Someone who's forgot all worries
a woman with courage
Someone who understands what you feel
even though you speak without words Sit down, we hold your hand
Tell who you are
We exist for each other
All memories would be nothing without you Like an ocean without water,
like a lantern without light
A life without colours, that's not you Someone you see when you close your eyes
like an angel before you
Someone who helps you
fly when you've forgot how to do it Beloved without feelings or laughter without sound
A life without colours, that's not you Someone who's forgot all worries
a woman with courage
Someone who understands what you feel

The Social Network Song (Oh Oh – Uh – Oh Oh),"[Intro]
Ooooh, ooh ooh
(I like)

[Verse 1]
Are you ready for a little chat?
And a song about the Internet
It's a story ‘bout a social door
You’ve never seen before

If you wanna be seen by everyone
Wanna be in the dream and have some fun
If you wanna be on the hook
Then simply take a look

[Chorus]
Oh oh, uh, oh oh
Everybody loves you so
Ooh ooh, uh, oh oh
Everybody that you know

[Verse 2]
Do you wanna be more than just a friend?
Do you wanna play cyber sex again?
If you wanna come to my house
Then click me with your mouse

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, uh, oh oh
Never gonna let you go

[Verse 3]
Your logging in, then it begins
And your computer is waking you
Taking your time away
The scene is right for social light
You're on the Internet, anywhere
Anytime, night and day

Oh oh, uh, oh oh *(I like)*
Everybody loves you so
Ooh ooh, uh, oh oh *(Mi piace)*
Never gonna let you go

Social network, oh *(Mi piace)*
Never gonna let you go

[Verse 5]
You’re login’ in with just a friend
But soon the Internet's
Beeping and peeping around the bend
We used to greet friends on the street
But now it’s googling, giggling, gaggling
When we meet

[Bridge]
Beep beep, uh, oh oh
""How about a little chat?""
(Oh oh, network fans)
Meet ya' at the internet

Do you really like politics?
Wanna talk about dirty tricks?
Are you really a sex machine
Or just a beauty queen?
Everybody is better than before
Everybody is calling out for more
Everybody in Cyber-ville
Is knocking on your door

[Chorus]
Beep beep, uh, oh oh *(I like)*
Everybody does a show
Ooh ooh, uh, oh oh *(Mi piace)*
If you like it click and go

[Verse 6]
Now you know it is easy loggin' in
For a little more fun and cyber sin
Wanna know what the net's about
The hard part's loggin' out

[Outro]
Ooh ooh, uh, oh oh
Now I've got a million friends
Goodbye, network fans
This is how the story ends
Ooh ooh, beep beep"

Just give me mo-o-ore

[Verse 2]
Reaching for the sky, I'm aiming high
Close my eyes and then it's almost like we fly
Up in the air
Let's take it there
Never let go oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh oh
Feel the energy
Between you and me
Baby, it's so right

Oh oh oh
I feel the energy
Just taking over me, over me

How I've been waiting for this
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la love
Oh, I've been waiting for this

La la la la la la love

[Verse 3]
Paris to LA over the night
All around the world just you and I
Nothing to fear
When you are near
We're on a ro-o-oll

And we do it again
No stop, no end
Out of control

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh oh
Feel the energy
Between you and me
Baby, it's so right

Oh oh oh
I feel the energy
Just taking over me, over me

Should've Known Better,"Should've known better
Now I miss you
Like Sahara misses rain
Changing like the weather
Maybe it's true
Maybe you're not gonna change

I feel like you have two homes
Yet I feel you are homeless
Where we live I feel like a stranger
When you home I feel even stranger

I live in no man's land
With no way home like you don't understand
Cuz you so here, you so there
Not really anywhere
She said

Should've known better
Now I miss you
Like Sahara misses rain
Changing like the weather
Maybe it's true
Maybe you're not gonna change

Feels like I'm always
Living out of my suitcase
What about all the years in between
Just trying to find my place

I live in no man's land
With no way home like you don't understand
Cuz you so here, you so there
Not really anywhere
She said

Shouting inshallah
Shouting inshallah
Shouting inshallah

She said
Shouting inshallah (oh)
Shouting inshallah (oh)
Shouting inshallah

We could've written words on a mountain high
Reminding ourselves to keep climbing, right
Sometimes we have to lose
A part of us to find the truth

Nothing more beautiful than the way
You use to breathe me to ya lungs and soul
Sometimes we have to say
I'm sorry I can't stay

Should've known better
Now I miss you
Like Sahara misses rain
Changing like the weather
Maybe it's true
Maybe it's true

Should've known better
Now I miss you
Like Sahara misses rain
Changing like the weather
Maybe it's true
Maybe we're not gonna change

Should've known better
Should've known better"

Lăutar,"Out there waiting tonight, she looks nicer than the bright
When she smiles I forget my lyrics
I got blind, I got mad, not from the diamond she had
But from the beauty that put my heart on fire

You have never been to my show
You haven’t seen before her looks, that trumpet
But the sound goes straight to your soul, gets you out of control
This trumpet makes you mine, girl

This trumpet makes you mine, girl
(This trumpet makes you mine, girl)
This trumpet makes you mine, girl

Just like from advertise you came down from the skies
On a plane which belongs to your daddy
Welcome to carousel, the one is real but you can’t
‘Cause too much is no good for her princess

You have never been to my show
You haven’t seen before her looks, that trumpet
But the sound goes straight to your soul, gets you out of control
This trumpet makes you mine, girl

(This trumpet makes you mine, girl)

You have never been to my show
You haven’t seen before her looks, that trumpet
But the sound goes straight to your soul, gets you out of control

Waterline,"Floodgates, can't wait
Here she comes, shut ‘em fast
Better shut ‘em fast
Too late, swept away
Feel the rush after the fact

Coming up beneath me
Never been in love so deeply before

I am close to the waterline
I thought that I'd been over my head for the last time
I'm so close to the waterline
And the way I'm loving her now
I know this is bound to go down as the big one

Whistle blast, lights flash
Throw a rope, grab a hold, feel the undertow
She laughs, waves crash
What's the use? I can't let her go

Coming up beneath me
Never been in love so deeply before

I am close to the waterline
I thought that I'd been over my head for the last time
I'm so close to the waterline
And the way I'm loving her now
I know this is bound to go down as the big one

Floodgates, can't wait
Here she comes, shut' em fast
Better shut ‘em fast
Too late, swept away
Feel the rush

I am close to the waterline
And the way I'm loving her now
I know this is bound to go down as the one

I am close to the waterline
I thought that I'd been over my head for the last time
I'm so close to the waterline
And the way I'm loving her now
I know this is bound to go down as the big one"

Crno i belo (Црно и бело),"Look into my eyes now,
I'm not a looser, know it!
I don't surrender till the end
there's no raising without falling. Open your soul and confess to me
Now, truly what are we
Half of me - inside of you
and half of you - sleeps inside me
Come on hug me now, and raise me to the sky Everything's black and white
One truth, and one lie
Even though together we are
cheerfulness I choose - you choose the sorrow. Everything's black and white
Goodness and badness can't be apart
Come on, give me a smile
The day leads me to shinny nights Look into my eyes now,
There everything you will find
Come on, surrender altogether
for new beginning - with me. Open your soul and confess to me
Now, what we truly are
Half of me - inside of you
and half of you - sleeps inside me
Come on hug me now, and raise me to the sky Everything's black and white

You and Me,"I was five, you were three
We were dancing in the street
And you looked just like an angel
You looked up and saw the sky
Saw the birds and wondered why
They could fly away so high

In the morning I would wake
And my heart just couldn't wait
To play in your backyard
In the evening I would go
Telling you I love you so
And I couldn't wait to see you again

It's you and me and everybody out there
And I can see that everybody knows
About you and me, but I don't really care for it
I can see that everybody knows about us

We grew up knowing love
Thanking God up above
That we could be together forever
We would never say goodbye
Cause we promised, you and I
But our love couldn't handle time

And I see you walking by my house
And wonder why we don't play around no more
Such a shame we have no time
They were wrong and we were right
I still love you and in my mind

It's you and me and everybody out there
And I can see that everybody knows
About you and me, but I don't really care for it
I can see that everybody knows about us

So I'm lying in bed thinking 'bout the old days
Thinking 'bout it all and how it ends sometimes
Was it wrong or right or was I good enough?

It's you and me and everybody out there
And I can see that everybody knows
About you and me and everybody out there
And I can see that everybody knows
About you and me, but I don't really care for it
I can see that everybody knows about us"

On a highway
When the world is deaf to all your cries

Hold on to me
I'll never let you fall
Even if someday all hope is gone

We are the heroes

We're breaking down the walls
We're gonna hit them all
Cause we are believers
We are the dreamers

No matter what they say
No matter what they do
I'll make it alright

We're breaking down the walls

As I stand beneath the starry sky
I just lose
Faith in gravity
And it feels like I can learn to fly
Bring to life
All my fantasies
You're not alone
We're against them all
Hold on to me
I'll never let you fall
Even if someday all hope is gone
I will not give up

Whatever's standing in my way
We'll make it through the day

Vida minha,"I walk along the streets of the city, old, dark, imperfect
It smells like yearning kisses, in a embellishing square
A child is running, a neighbour is peeking
And within me the desire to return and embrace you
And within me the desire to return and embrace you If you were light, my love, oh light of the day
Inspiring smile of fantasy
If you were water, my love, like pure water
That quenches the thirst of the tenderness flower If you were light, my love, oh light of the day
Inspiring smile of fantasy
But among everything you can become in your life
I only want, my love, be the life of mine And within me the desire to return and embrace you If you were light, my love, oh light of the day
Inspiring smile of fantasy
If you were water, my love, like pure water
That quenches the thirst of the tenderness flower If you were light, my love, oh light of the day
Inspiring smile of fantasy
But among everything you can become in your life
I only want, my love, be the life of mine But among everything you can become in your life
I only want, my love, be the life of mine"

I am longing from the bottom of my heart, drawing sun across the sky
Over the dreams just for him, casting light﻿ onto his shadows
To bid farewell of memories which have holes
As between the palms of hands, while the sand of time drains I believe that again, we will reconcile
And yesterday will return for good with streams﻿ of light
Even the song will find it’s rhymes if I hold to him Ah… ah… ah… ah… I sense I am drawing to a close, a silent voice is singing in minor scale
However, the wind will not blow air into my white flags I believe that again, we will reconcile
And yesterday will return for good with streams﻿ of light
A new day is shining a real sun﻿ Oh… (Because I do not surrender towards the end)
(Because I do not surrender towards the end)
Because I do not surrender towards the end
I survive only by it’s way
That I long for, oh…"
Nebo,"Listen to me when I tell you
I've tried everything

and people tell me you don't care
it's like I've lost my mind
I still hope for you Ref:
Well, heaven gives everything back in return
and remembers every debt
we all dream
but heaven decides our path Heaven gives everyting back in return
God sees everything
and these tears of mine
you'll carry upon your conscience I'll hide
behind the wet, cold streets
so I'll never see anyone
so I never meant anything to you But I hear you're kissing others
and people tell me you don't care
it's like I've lost my mind
I still hope for you Ref:"

Wait, there is still the light
Listen to how your land is breathing
Listen...now Listen to what remained in the silence
Listen to these simple moments only
Listen, also the heart has a voice Listen to the voice of a rainbow
Look, and you will see soon
Listen, it is song of the living
Listen...only Listen to what remained in the silence
Listen to these simple moments only
Listen, also the heart has a voice The road has passed into shadows
I am still looking and searching
It is the power of silence - the sound
I am waiting you here, halfway
Listen, my voice is calling Listen to what remained in the silence
Listen to these simple moments only
Listen, my heart has a voice Listen to what the horizon says
Listen to how far it brings
Listen to what the wind has yet to say

Don't Close Your Eyes,"God save me

Hey, where is the way to heaven’s hell
That’s what I ask when I feel broken

Look around what’s happening abounds
And listen to the frequency of a sound
Of the beat, of a heartbeat, of your death beat

Don’t close your eyes
And pray all the night
Try to call all angels
To save our lives

How do you feel now?
After all fails in love
Embraced by devil’s arms

Look around what’s happening abounds
And listen to the frequency of a sound
Of the beat, of a heartbeat, of your death beat

Don’t close your eyes
And pray all the night
Try to call all angels
To save our lives

Let me get out of here
Let me get out of here
Let me get out of here
Let me get out of here

Save me

Don’t close your eyes (Stay awake)
And pray all the night (Say your prayer now)
Try to call all angels (Angels above)
To save our lives (Save our lives)

Don’t close your eyes (Don’t close your eyes)
To save our lives"
Stay,"I hear the music as I walk down the street
Start moving to the rhythm, heart is pumping the beat
I hear the people shout out, “Turn up the music louder”
Better start running if you can’t stand the heat

What’s it doing to me? I feel it setting me free
It’s like I’m losing all control
You know it’s making me hot and baby I don’t stop
It’s like a fire in my soul

I don’t know what I’m doing tonight
But this rushing is making me stronger
I don’t know if it’s wrong or it’s right
But I know I want you to stay
Nananananana stay, nananananana

Heart beats faster as I stand in the crowd
My meters are peaking, I can tell you’re around
It’s like I wanna (shout out), nothing can pull me (down now)
Sirens are calling and I can’t kill the sound

What’s it doing to me? I feel it setting me free
It’s like I’m losing all control
You know it’s making me hot and baby I don’t stop
It’s like a fire in my soul

I don’t know what I’m doing tonight
But this rushing is making me stronger
I don’t know if it’s wrong or it’s right
But I know I want you to stay
Nananananana stay, nananananana

What can move your body baby?
You better, nananananana, you better, nananananana
Come on now, what can move your body baby?
You better, nananananana, you better

I don’t know what I’m doing tonight
But this rushing is making me stronger
I don’t know if it’s wrong or it’s right
But I know I want you to stay

I don’t know what I’m doing tonight
But this rushing is making me stronger
I don’t know if it’s wrong or it’s right
But I know I want you to stay
Nananananana stay, nananananana"
Korake ti znam,"I know your steps, you rush like without your head
Where, I don’t ask, because if I ask, you stay silent
And it’s ever harder to part with you and your body
And I know you less and less, that’s not what I wanted It’s as if I’m stealing you away from everybody just for me
May they leave you, may they not touch you
I poisin blood and soul most when I wound you
And I still hate it all while I defend myself in front of you Don’t ruin my day, it’s never been harder for me
You’ve never lived alone in a spider’s web
Like I have, life connects me to you
Will it ever get easier or only harder, eh…. When you easily put our whole life in a gamble
As if we never said: “Till death do us part” Don’t ruin my day, it’s never been harder for me
You’ve never lived alone in a spider’s web
Like I have…
Like I have..."
Love Is Blind,"When the day becomes the night
You know that I think of you
And I cannot control my heart
It’s crying for you
Loneliness is killing me
I’m helpless without your love
Knowing when you touch someone
I can’t understand

Now it’s tearing me apart, I want you back
And it’s made me realise just what I had

[Chorus]
Love is blind, it’s true, nobody is like you
My endless melody I play for me and you
Love is blind, it’s true, I’m on my knees for you
‘Cause I’d give it all I can to have you back again
Love is blind

I just can’t believe you’re gone and I let it slip away
I can’t believe I was the one who caused you pain
I said you should know deep down inside
She didn’t mean a thing to me, yeah
What can I do to win back your heart and make you to stay?

I can’t believe, can’t believe you’re gone
I can’t believe…

[Chorus]
Love is blind, it’s true, nobody is like you
My endless melody I play for me and you
Love is blind, it’s true, I’m on my knees for you
‘Cause I’d give it all I can to have you back again
Love is blind

Love is blind"
Love Will Set You Free,"So graceful and pure, a smile bathed in light
No matter the distance a mirical of sight
Though I should have known, I could not turn away
But faced with your beauty, no reason can stay

As you kiss him in the moonlight, with heavy words I say
If you love someone, follow your heart
'Cause love comes once if you're lucky enough
Though I'll miss you forever, the hurt will run deep
Only love can set you free

Trust in your dreams, run with no fear
And if you should stumble, remember I'm near
As a ghost I will walk, I'll look deep in my soul
I might find another, you gave me that hope

So as you kiss him in the moonlight, with heavy words I say
If you love someone, follow your heart
Because love comes once if you're lucky enough
Though I'll miss you forever, and the hurt will run deep
Only love can set you free

And if you love someone, follow your heart
'Cause love comes once if you're lucky enough
Though I'll miss you forever, the hurt will run deep
Love will set you free"
Echo (You and I),"You and I, you and I I can hear the echo of our steps, all in sync
Marching in lock-step, never heading in the same direction
We're making progress, but what are we running after? I can hear the echo of our dreams, of our desires
Beyond the day, until the night
We're tagging along with each other - and what are we running after? We get lost, we hope for each other
Somewhere we get astray
One day
We will find each other again In my dreams, in my dreams
In my heart, in my mind
I see you and I, there is you and I I can hear the echo of our unfirm steps
Here and there, always dancing the same dance
We're making progress, but what are we running after? We get lost, we hope for each other
Somewhere we get astray
One day
We will find each other again In my dreams, in my dreams
In my heart, in my mind
I see you and I, there is you and I There is you and I, there is you and I I can hear the echo of you voice that is going away from me
The echo of a love will return one day
It's carrying me along and I'm running after you We get lost, we hope for each other
Somewhere we get astray
One day
We will find each other again In my dreams, in my dreams
In my heart, in my mind
I see you and I, there is you and I"
L'amore è femmina (Out of Love),"Ma che caldo fa oggi la città
Ha un martello nella testa che fa boom, boom, boom
Pioggia isterica, sai che novità
La gente che mi giudica e tu boom, boom, boom

Non so se tornerai, non so se ci sei
Non mi chiami mai, no, no, no, no
Dimmi, se piangi mai?
Dimmi dove vai quando ti vorrei

L’amore è femmina, se non riceve non si da
(Tic tac, non riceve non si da)
La prendo comoda, calcolo le possibilità
(Tic tac, una possibilità)

Quello che vuoi se non ce l’hai?
Siamo tutti insoddisfatti, come mai?
Femmina, se non riceve non si da
Lala lala lala la…

Ooh… lalalala…

Sento il panico, cerco ossigeno
La paranoia sale e tu butti giù
Non pretendere che sia semplice
Ho un martello dentro al cuore che fa boom, boom, boom

(Non so se tornerai) Non so se ci sei
Non mi chiami mai, no, no, no, no

Dimmi dove vai quando ti vorrei

Ma che caldo fa
Confesserò che no mi perdo niente davvero
Ho immaginato noi due solo col pensiero

L’amore è femmina, e non riceve non si da

When the Music Dies,"You, you were my best friend
You were my everything
So don't leave me now

You, you were the best of me
The reason that I believe
So don't leave me now

And I, tried to keep us alive
But you were cold cold cold
Now every second that my heart skips it ends
But I, still wanna keep us alive
But it's cold cold cold cold

When the music dies
It's all black and white
And there's no sunrise
When the music dies

Now you, you can't even look at me
You say you're not gonna speak to me
Oh oh oh oh

And I, tried to keep us alive
But you were cold cold cold
Now every second that my heart skips it ends
But I, still wanna keep us alive
But it's cold cold cold cold

When the music dies
It get's cold when there's no sunrise
So cold, now every second that my heart skips it ends

And I, tried to keep us alive
Oh but you were cold cold cold
Now every second, my heart beat ends
But I, still wanna keep us, alive
But you were cold cold
Oh... When the music dies"
Quédate conmigo,"Sorry if I didn't know how to say
That you were everything to me
Sorry for the pain Forgive each tear
I know I don't deserve more
But if I don't have you here with me, I don't know how to live
Stay with me, don't go Forgive me if I didn't know how to love you
The heart wasn't mine
Stay with me, stay with me
If you're not here the sun doesn't shine There are now no memories of only yesterday
Only the hours in your skin, loving you
Stay with me, don't go Forgive me if I didn't know how to love you
The heart wasn't mine
Stay with me, stay with me
The sun doesn't shine when you're not here And now that I see you leave
I know I won't forget you If I didn't know how to love you
The heart wasn't mine
Stay with me, stay with me
If you're not here the sun doesn't shine And now that I see you leave
I know I won't forget you
Stay with me, stay with me
The sun doesn't shine when you're not here"
Standing Still,"Guess we knew this was coming on
Cause you're already gone in my head
You can tell me that I'm wrong
That you're staying with me instead
When winter's come along
And summer's dead and gone
Is there anything left here to say?
I can put my arms around
The emptiness I found
And find a way to make you stay

But I'm standing still
I'm standing still
As you leave me now
I'm standing still
I'm standing still
As you're walking out
Yeah, I'm just standing still
Now before I felt so strong
And pieces of me break so easy
What I thought would be the end
Is just the feeling that you freed me

Girl, this ain't giving up
It's knowing where to stop
Knowing when a thing is over
I know my life is blind
See for the first time
This ain't gonna bring us closer

Cause I'm standing still
I'm standing still
As you leave me now
Yeah, I'm standing still
I'm standing still
As you're walking out

I'm standing still
And I'm just standing still
As you leave me now
And I'm just standing still
When winter's come along
And summer's dead and gone
Is there anything left here to say?
I can put my arms around
The emptiness I found
And find a way to make you stay

I'm standing still
I'm standing still
As you leave me now
Yeah, I'm standing still
I'm standing still
As you're walking out
I'm just standing still
I'm standing still
Yeah, I'm just standing still
Just standing still"
Shine,"When hurt is all you’re feeling your heart is slowly bleeding
The only memories to hold on to
When you almost stop believing, you’re cold, alone and freezing
You think you’re lost and don’t know where to go
Look up to the startling sky, relight the fire

You will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky
You will shine, I see the light in your eyes
You will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky
Oh you will fly up high, the light is in your eyes
Trust me, you will shine

Time is always healing and answers are revealing
Sometimes they’re simply right before your eyes
But when you’re down here kneeling there is no chance to see it
You can when all these dark clouds disappear
Look up to the startling sky, relight the fire

You will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky
You will shine, I see the light in your eyes
You will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky
Oh you will fly up high, the light is in your eyes
Trust me, you will shine

Still alive and breathing
Still alive and breathing
Still alive and breathing, still alive and breathing
Still alive and breathing

You will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky
You will shine, I see the light in your eyes
You will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky
Oh you will fly up high, the light is in your eyes

Oh you will fly up high, the light is in your eyes
Trust me, you will shine"
Et uus saaks alguse,"I still remember when my soul settled
That feeling so overwhelming and yet
I’m standing on the road searching my heart, battered by the wind But I know, I know that things can get better
Every door that closes eventually opens again The snow will melt and the bare trees will blossom
Every ending is just a new beginning
We need the night, the day can bring us light
So there could be a new beginning
Let bygones be bygones
So there could be a new beginning once again The curtain is raised again and the second act is starting
Where I pick myself up and dust myself down
However the new game will be changed more towards my fate
I’m taking a different path But I know, I know that things can get better
Every door that closes eventually opens again The snow will melt and the bare trees will blossom
Every ending is just a new beginning
We need the night, the day can bring us light
So there could be a new beginning
Let bygones be bygones The snow will melt and the bare trees will blossom
Every ending is just a new beginning
We need the night, the day can bring us light
So there could be a new beginning
Let bygones be bygones
So there could be a new beginning once again"
Straight into Love,"Faster than light here comes the night
Tomorrow is now
You flow through my veins, inside me you'll stay
There is no doubt
You're one in this world, no diamonds no pearls
Like your love divine
So high off the ground, we'll never come down
No limit no sky
Straight into love, well break through the dark
And light the world up from the sky when we collide
Straight into love and never let go
Well light the world up from the sky into the night
No turning the tide, with eyes open wide
There's no stopping now
With all that we have we stand on the edge
Before we die down
Straight into love, we'll break through the dark
And light the world up from the sky when we collide
Straight into love
Well light the world up from the sky into the night
We found the place where we belong
Out of the dark our flame is strong
We're moving fast, we won't look back
Higher and higher we go
Straight into love, oh
Straight into love
Straight into love
We'll light the world up from the sky into the night"
Mižerja,"I don't have gold
to give you
Only these two arms
to hug your soul Oh misery, you're as hard as rock
Oh misery, you're like two drops of wine
I have nothing but faith and a little bit
of pure love Oh beautiful rose of mine,
For you I will live
And the last piece of dried old bread
I'll share with you Oh misery, you're as hard as rock
Oh misery, you're like two drops of wine
I have nothing but faith and a little bit
of pure love"
Only Teardrops,"[Verse 1]
The sky is red tonight
We're on the edge tonight
No shooting star to guide us

[Pre-Chorus]
Eye for an eye
Why tear each other apart?
Please tell me why
Why do we make it so hard?
Look at us now
We only got ourselves to blame
It's such a shame

[Chorus]
How many times can we win and lose?
How many times can we break the rules between us?
Only teardrops
How many times do we have to fight?
How many times till we get it right between us?
Only teardrops

[Verse 2]
So come and face me now
Here on the stage tonight
Let's leave the past behind us

Eye for an eye
Why tear each other apart?
Please tell me why
Why do we make it so hard?
Look at us now
We only got ourselves to blame
It's such a shame

Tell me how many times can we win and lose?
How many times can we break the rules between us?
Only teardrops
How many times do we have to fight?
How many times till we get it right between us?
Only teardrops

What's come between us?
What's come between us?
Only teardrops
What's come between us?
What's come between us?

How many times can we win and lose?
How many times can we break the rules between us?
Only teardrops
How many times do we have to fight?
How many times till we get it right between us?

What If,"What if I could change the path of time
What if I had the power to decide
What if I could make us unify

If I
If I

What if we would open up the doors
What if we could help each other more
What if i could make you all believe

If we
If we


What if we all
Opened our arms

What if we
Came together as one

What if we aimed
To stop the alarms

What if we chose to
Bury our guns

Why don’t we always
Reach out to those

Who need us the most

Together we can change the path of time
Together we have power to decide
The answer lies within our hearts and minds

Together
Together

Together we can make a better place
On this little island out in space
Together we can change the world forever

Let’s unite and make a change
Let’s unite and write a new page
Come on sinners come on saints
Have faith"
Gravity,"Nothing comes from dreams but dreams
Still you believe in wonder
Something happens and it seems
Like a strike of thunder

Nothing comes from love but love
Why is it growing stronger?
I am falling from above
I will wait no longer

I’m like a butterfly
Spinning ‘round a sword as if to dare
I should have stayed up high
It’s stronger than me
My gravity
My gravity

Nothing comes from pride but pride
My way is clear
Dancing on the edge tonight
Now I feel no fear

I’m like a butterfly
Spinning ‘round a sword as if to dare
I should have stayed up high
It’s stronger than me
My gravity
My gravity

I’m like a butterfly
My gravity
I’m like a butterfly
And I should have stayed up high
It’s stronger than me
My gravity
My gravity
Gravity!"
Birds,"Isolated from the outside
Clouds have taken all the light
I have no control
It seems my thoughts wonder all of the time
When I try to live life without you

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride

If being myself is what I do wrong
Then I would rather not be right
Hopes turned into fear
And with my one wing I can't fly with sunrise
Embrace my dreams tight
And that's why

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
Birds

To a place without fear with no moonlight
All I need are trees and flowers and some sunlight
Where memories are being made
And where the old one dies
Where love ain't lost

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
That's why birds don't fly"
Igranka (Игранка),"(I'm taking you to the dance, to-to-to-to the dance)
(Ce-ce-ce-ce, the dance I'm taking you to the dance)
(I'm taking you to the dance, to-to-to-to the dance)
(Ce-ce-ce-ce, the dance I'm taking you to the dance) It's a party, it can't end,
beat for beat, verse for verse,
the whole world's shaking along with her,
with one move also and the universe. C'mon take me, free me,
from the nasty stress during the year,
I can no longer be paranoid,
it smells like a good party. The dance without stopping on the outside,
on a stage or near a bar itself,
when the day dawns, we're here, it's never a wasteland,
nothing's a big deal, you just need to get into a stunt. The kick and bass, they infect, they destroy,
nobody will come with established bazaars,
tomorrow again along the trodden paths,
I'm hanging out with my friends, I'm not thinking about the money. Ref.
Let it last all night and all day,
it'll get more, it'll get more better trust me,
because we've been born for it,
I'm taking you I'm taking you, come with me. Come with me now,
this is the night,
the end can't be seen.
(I'm taking you to the dance) I need a party that'll never end,
while a woman shakes that piece of meat,
the heat is on 200 like in a microwave,
our brains'll explode, a stroboscope makes flashes. The beat is sick, it's banging on my head,
my wallet is empty, give me a drink,
a grill, a clove, a parsley, a fish,
give me everything to get fed. And take me somewhere to clear my head,
somewhere where the music is playing loud,
so that it doesn't stop, that it just keeps grooving,
that it lasts all night and that everyone are a tuna. The pressure is being suffered, I'm coping with struggle,
take me somewhere so that I don't explode,
I'm opening a can, life is a miracle,
let's go to the dance, where should we go else ? Ref.
Let it last all night and all day,
it'll get more, it'll get more better trust me,
because we've been born for it,
I'm taking you I'm taking you, come with me. Come with me now,
this is the night,
the end can't be seen.
(I'm taking you to the dance) Just let the beat banging,
I like everybody here,
and it doesn't matter that,
we all have a thin wallet. Just let the beat banging,
I like everybody here,
if the money doesn't help,
music always will. (I'm taking you to the dance, to-to-to-to the dance)

Something,"I have to tell you something
It’s been on my mind so long
I’ve got to tell you this
It’s been on my mind way too long
I promised myself to tell
Instead I’m falling apart to see you here

If you don’t know I’m in love with you
When summertime falls It becomes untrue
Because of my shoes I’m wearing today
One is called Love the other is Pain

So tell me now
I’m in your head I’m in your heart tell me now
Tell me now because I’m falling apart to see you here

If you don’t know I’m in love with you
When summertime falls It becomes untrue
Because of my shoes I’m wearing today
One is called Love, the other is Pain

But still you don’t know I’m in love with you
When summertime falls It becomes untrue
Because of my shoes I’m wearing today

One is called Love, the other is Pain
One is called Love, the other is Pain"
Solayoh,"Friday night was going nowhere…
Sitting in a small café
Feeling lonely, a little tired
I’ve been working hard all day

Then a noise caught my attention
And I heard a wonderful sound;
Coming at me like a tsunami
Nearly took my feet off the ground

A rush of excitement flowed into my ears
Oh, beautiful people, ah ha-hi ha-hi-ha!
Hi-ia-ia-ia!

Solayoh, Solayoh, where the sun is always shining on ya
We play-oh, we play-oh to the rhythm of a cha-cha
Solayoh, Solayoh, turn the music up, it's gonna get ya
We play-oh, we play-oh, we can make it into a hot night

Situation started improving
Maybe this was kismet now
And my body started moving
I was really shaking down

Something happened when I was dancing
I could feel that powerful beat
Taking me to new dimensions
Waking up the devil in me

A heavenly chorus and love all around
Oh, beautiful people, ah ha-hi ha-hi-ha!
Hi-ia-ia-ia!

Solayoh, Solayoh, where the sun is always shining on ya
We play-oh, we play-oh to the rhythm of a cha-cha
Solayoh, Solayoh, turn the music up, it's gonna get ya
We play-oh, we play-oh, we can make it into a hot night

It feels like I'm dreaming, this word makes no sense
Let's sing it again now, “Ah ha-i!”

Solayoh, Solayoh where the sun is always shining on ya
We play-oh, we play-oh to the rhythm of a cha-cha
Solayoh, Solayoh, turn the music up, it's gonna get ya
We play-oh, we play-oh, we can make it into a hot night
Solayoh, Solayoh, turn the music up, it's gonna get ya
We play-oh, we play-oh, we can make it into a hot night
We can make it into cha-cha!"
O mie,"A thousand sunsets lost in the sea, lost inside us,
On our eyelashes a thousand rays of sun would bring the morning light for the two of us
A thousand burning shooting stars had enchanted us,
Into the skies a thousand secular nights had vanished.
We had stayed strong. Chorus: (X2)
The sun and the rains give birth to a thousand colours
But all we can see are the clouds,
Memories of us that we had written together
But then destroyed. A thousand tears can’t wash away the suffering
I’ve been through since I lost you.
For a thousand nights I’ve fallen silent, silence wants me to forget you,
It asks too much of me,
I don’t think it belongs to the past, the thrill I felt,
I want a new beginning! Chorus (X2)
I believed in your love, I had hoped that it would not dry out,
I believed in great dreams, but you chose to go away,
I thought it didn’t belong to the past, the thrill I felt,
I want a new beginning. Chorus (X2)"
Only Love Survives,"All our lives
We’ve been afraid
Watching the world decline
Till nothing remains
But in our darkness hour
Right before the dawn
The old world dies
The new day is born

We’re gonna live like it’s our last night alive
And we’re dancing till the morning light
And even if the sun don’t rise
In the end only love survives
So be love
Be love
Just be love (just be love)
Only love (only love)
We are love (we are love)
Only love (only love)
And when the stars are aligned
You got to make love your state of
Mind ‘cause in the end
Only love survives
So let the world collide
Don’t be afraid
If it’s the end of time
Love will remain
To live like it’s the last night alive
And we’re dancing till the morning light
And even if the sun don’t rise
In the end only love survives

So be love
Be love
Just be love (just be love)
Only love (only love)
We are love (we are love)
Only love (only love)
And when the stars are aligned
You got to make love your state of mind
Cause in the end only love survives
So be love (be love)
Only love love love
So make love(be love)
Only love love love
Cause in the end only love survives"
An me thimase (Aν με θυμάσαι),"I don't regret the things I lived through
I don't ask for apologies for all that I loved
For all I want my soul takes off
And I thank you for all you gave me If you remember me, tell me if I'll see you again
I'll always be waiting here for you For all that connected two hearts
For all we felt together, I miss you
And I'll be in you're most difficult goodbyes
In the sweetest of your ""I love you's"" If you remember me, tell me if I'll see you again
If you remember me, tell me if I'll see you again
I'll always be waiting here for you If you remember me
Become a bright star so I'll see you when night falls
in the sky If you remember me
Become a star so I can see you in the sky"
Love Kills,"[Verse 1]
So the arrow shot right through her heart and rocked her to the core
And she fell so deep like she had never fell so deep before
But the pain was almost unbelievable
When the end was near, she felt the fear alive

[Chorus]
Waiting for the bitter pill
Give me something i can feel
'Cos love kills over and over
Love kills over and over
Waiting for the bitter pill
Something i can truly feel
‘Cos love kills over and over
Love kills over and again

[Verse 2]
‘Cos he didn’t fight for life when he was up against the wall
And he felt so scared for both of them even though they had it all
There’s a lesson that you always have to learn
Through the consequence of fire comes the burn


[Chorus]
Waiting for the bitter pill
Give me something i can feel
‘Cos love kills over and over
Love kills over and over
Waiting for the bitter pill
Something i can truly feel
‘Cos love kills over and over
Love kills over and again

[Bridge]
One last, one last, one last breath for life
Won’t you give me, give me hope tonight

[Chorus]
Waiting for the bitter pill
Give me something i can feel
Love kills over and over
Love kills over and over
Waiting for the bitter pill
Something i can truly feel
'Cos love kills over and over
And love kills over and again
Love kills over and over
And love kills over and again
Love kills over and over
And love kills over and again"
Ljubav je svuda (Љубав је свуда),"Love Love Doesnt Exists they say
They lie dont be afraid
When they go
Love for life and more
With him it will be I will ask you for a year
When he cheats you like on lots the sides
Your heart is food for fishes
You  need to know I am like so crazy
Little want little dont
To believe because i dont know if i can
Yes love si everywhere
Little hurts little dont
I tried everything with him
And maybe that more,something You dream,youre dreaming a world in a blue color
Youre dreaming because hes yours
Dont listen anymore to his lies
Kiss him,and say him ok I am so crazy
Little want little dont
To believe because i dont know if i can
Yes love si everywhere
Little hurts little dont

And maybe that more,something I will wait him every night to morning

Believe me sister im being good to you

Love is everywhere
Yes love is everywhere
Little love little dont"
Here We Go,"[Intro]

[Chorus]
Here we go, here we go
So alive, in the sky, we can fly
Here we go, here we go
So alive, in the sky, we can fly

[Verse 1]
Ladies and Gentlemen, I need a starlight
'Cuz never have I had a day without a fight
I slide through the darkness it took me to a height
Of a lonesome, cold and a never ending night
I'm the man on the moon call me Andy Kaufman
There are demons inside me but I'mma stop 'em
I, I know I can be an unstoppable force
I try, man, let me take a walk on the bright side

So alive, in the sky, we can fly

So alive, in the sky, we can fly

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
A lot of thoughts in my head keep pulling me down
So many guests in my house I couldn't notice the sound
Of the doorbell telling they're about to come
I'm surrounded by problems I got to run
(But no) I keep pulling myself up
(But no) I keep pulling myself up
I'm on a mission to fulfil my vision
All day everyday - never ever, ever give up

Here we go, here we go
So alive, in the sky, we can fly
Here we go, here we go
So alive, in the sky, we can fly

[Instrumental]

Here we go, here we go
So alive, in the sky, we can fly
Here we go, here we go
So alive, in the sky, we can fly

Crisalide (Vola),"There were times when I felt
An emptiness inside of me
It used to call me
Come right now to see the truth
There's a bridge over immensity What am I after all
A fragile God's dream
With a body like this
Big colorful eyes, we die while living
Renewed for eternity Fly, fly and the strength will come
Always alone heading to another freedom
New butterfly always leaves
An empty chrysalis in which
you used to be Clouds are showing
That the rain will fall
It will happen all of a sudden
The wings are wet of tears and they can't be dried
And then the wind will come And you fly, fly, fly away from you
Always alone until the reflection appears
In the mirror that steals the image
In thousands of pieces of vertigo
And the light will shine So much life around
I never noticed it
And if you still don't know
We are the universe Fly, fly and the strength will come
Always alone heading to another freedom
New butterfly always leaves
An empty chrysalis in which
you used to be Fly into joy
You'll never be alone in our immensity anymore
In a moment love will change everything
like the new sun Fly, fly, fly with me"
Pred da se razdeni (Пред да се раздени),"You will be a good housewife to someone else,
the eternal maker of the silken linen,*
to somebody who fell into your life right from Mars,**
to somebody who an intelligent person would not believe. You will be faithful, honest to someone else,
like you were poison to me at all times.
In the shadows,in the veins,you'll leave a trace
but I won't ever again (come)to your doorstep. May all your years without me be happy.
Tonight when I leave,
(in)between the unhappy,to intercept with you
again; the soul would wish for. Esma,you will be a song,

Hold Me,"Should have seen it coming when I saw you
Should have had the sense to stop and walk away
It was gonna turn out complicated
We´ve hit overload about to explode

If love was a mountain
I´d climb up to the highest of them all
I´d swim across the ocean if you´d call
I´m lost in your smile
Freefalling for miles

Hold me
Just unfold me
Unchain my soul
Give me love make me whole
Hold me
If it´s only
For this moment in time
Now I´m yours and your mine
So Hold me

Take a little time then you´ll know better
Than to think about giving in on the one you love
Can we go back and freeze the moment
Where we used to be free was only you and me

Hold me
Just unfold me
Unchain my soul
Give me love make me whole
Hold me
If it´s only
For this moment in time
Now I´m yours and your mine
So Hold me
Hold me

Remember how we used to laugh
But now you´re running from the past
Let´s find a way to carry on
Remember how love used to be
You said I was your fantasy
Can´t take another night alone
So come on home

Hold me
Just unfold me
Unchain my soul
Give me love make me whole
Hold me
If it´s only
For this moment in time
Now I´m yours and your mine
So Hold me
Hold me – Hold me…"

Tomorrow,"His name is Jeremy, working in IT
Never questions why he has always been
An extra careful guy, sensitive and shy
Risk assessment is his investment in a life of no surprise
Till she walked into his life

She's spontaneous indeed, uncertainty's her creed
She has always been neither black or white
Just a curious delight
She threw affection his direction, a collection of her smiles
And to his surprise

She's like tomorrow, oh so distant, she just wants to play
Like tomorrow she is always one day away
All the time she slips away it's close but yet so far
It's time to follow her tomorrow
Time to follow her tomorrow

He fell for her too fast, we all thought it wouldn't last
'Cause good ol' Jeremy likes his rigorous routine
'Cause he only thinks today, but tomorrow is away
To find a new direction and you'll be okay

She's like tomorrow, oh so distant, she just wants to play
Like tomorrow she is always one day away
All the time she slips away it's close but yet so far
It's time to follow her tomorrow

Time to follow her tomorrow
Time to follow her tomorrow
Time to follow her tomorrow

She's like tomorrow, oh so distant, she just wants to play
Like tomorrow she is always one day away
One day away (One day away)
One day away (One day away)

All the time she slips away it's close but yet so far
It's time to follow her tomorrow
It's time to follow her tomorrow
It's time to follow her tomorrow"

Ég á líf,"I went on the longest journey.
I went on, restlessly.
Thought of nothing, not even the next day.
The loneliness and quietness I chose. I have life, I have life, over hardship I drift.
I have life, I have life because of you.
When difficulties come, over mountains high, I climb
I have life, I have life, I have life. I didn't understand the love that made everything move
Was scared to embrace and to exist.
Felt I didn't deserve to open my mind
and let the bright light of love step in. I have life, I have life, over hardship I drift.
I have life, I have life because of you.
When difficulties come, over mountains high, I climb
I have life, I have life, I have life. And I believe, yes I believe
The beautiful sky might open
and the breathtaking love will flow over me. I have life, I have life, over hardship I drift.
I have life, I have life because of you.
When difficulties come, over mountains high, I climb
I have life, I have life because of you.
I have life, I have life, I have life."
Alcohol Is Free,"The heavy sea found us (when we were passing) through Via Egnatia1

Rak bishvilo (רק בשבילו),"Again, in the nights, the rain stops its drops.
[I'm] still trying to capture a smile from between his lips.
How much silence speaks; how much it hides,
How much truth has remained between the pondering. Only for him will I be able to forget the cold,
And thanks to him will I find, in the darkness, the light;
Only for him, will I walk and cross the boundaries,
Only with him will I know the answers to the questions. Only for him will I be able to forget the cold,
And thanks to him will I find, in the darkness, the light;
Only for him, will I walk and cross the boundaries,
Only with him will I know the answers to the questions. Again, in the days, I shall [hold onto] a warm and enveloping gaze; still attempting to caress his face in silence. How many tears have passed, and how many have remained; how many hopes were built, and how many have been broken. Only for him will I be able to forget the cold,
And thanks to him will I find - in the darkness - the light;
Only for him, will I walk and cross the boundaries,
Only with him will I know the answers to the questions. Only for him will I be able to forget the cold,
And thanks to him will I find, in the darkness, the light;
Only for him, will I walk and cross the boundaries,
Only with him will I know the answers to the questions. Again, in the days, I shall hold onto a warm and enveloping gaze; still attempting to caress his face in silence. Only for him will I be able to forget the cold,

Lonely Planet,"Who's the one that starts a war?
Who's dictating what is less and more?
Who can change the night and day?
Who's the one with clever face?
That can tell us what is in the space?
Playing games that none can play

Maybe someday we'll break the wall
Maybe the light will touch us all

Lonely planet!
Who has done it?
Who can save you?
Who can stop it?

Who's the one that has the right?
Treat us wrong and tell us what is right?
Bringing crowd against the squad…
Who has honesty to show?
Who can tell us “I don't know” ?
Who's the man and who's the god?

Maybe someday we'll break the wall
Maybe the light will touch us all

Lonely planet!
Who has done it?
Who can save you?
Who can stop it?
Lonely planet!
We have done it!
We can save you?

We can stop it
We can stop it…
We can stop it…
We can stop it…
For the world"
Kedvesem (Zoohacker Remix),"My darling is the kind of girl
Who is raised by the wolves and
Danced with a mirage then
Evaporated silently
My darling
She is my darling My darling is the kind of girl
Who is embraced by 7 continents
Plashing in beautiful seas
And dancing among the clouds
My darling
She is my darling Refr:
Because I don't have anyone else now
Just the darling, my darling
Wherever she is
That's nice for me, that's nice for me
She always founds me
My darling, my darling
I would croon that:
That's nice for me, that's nice for me
This song. My darling is the kind of girl
Who is torn by whimsical dreams
Her disheveled hair is twisted by the winds every morning
That's why my darling is different
She is my darling My darling is bearding
With the infinity and never dread
Creates a chariot out of rosemary
And pulling by cicadas
That's how she calms me silently
She is my darling Refr:
Beceause I don't have anyone else now
Just the darling, my darling
Wherever she is
That's nice for me, that's nice for me
She always founds me
My darling, my darling
I would croon that:
That's nice for me, that's nice for me
This song. I don't have anyone else now
Just the darling, my darling
Wherever she is
That's nice for me, that's nice for me
She always founds me

I Feed You My Love,"A cocoon, In a silent tree
Through the dark night
You listen to me when I whisper
Broken words In your ear
And you push
You push me hard to the surface
I'm blinded at heart but you wake me
Wake me up from the snow
Where I was born

[Chorus:]
Now I can see
The whole world is mine
I can touch and feel
I feed you my love

You put a knife against my back
And you dare me to face the attack
You say for cowards there's no reward
Feel the heat
Take my hand I trust your word
Bring the fire, I don't care if it hurts
I have the future, on my tongue
Give me a kiss

[Chorus]
Now I can see
The whole world is mine
I can touch and feel
So I feed you my love

You put a knife against my back
And you dare me to face the attack
You say for cowards there's no reward
I have the future on my tongue

Now I can see
The whole world is mine
I can touch and feel
So I feed you my love
Feed you my love
So I feed you my love"
Identitet,"Hey, hey I came from afar
a curse and cloud in the time of dust found
was I very nearby and touched only fire wild
spoke in silence only, wished merely a glory The dream I found, when parted out
a gleam of light, a slight breath just like you
a gleam of light, a slight breath just like you, Incoming from afar
seeing changes, a thirst, a yearning you've got
life itself gone, flies away,  this language asks for
it was a place where you were born, shared the bravery
the love for years you had gifted 2x
You ran, freedom you found This land raised us
one language only speak we shall, no more tears hence
all around the world be, a stranger no more you shall
in communion and brotherhood, let the new start commence
because the dream I found when I parted out 4x
A gleam of light, a breath like you
you ran, freedom you found"
Waterfall,"There's no me without you
Don't know what I would do
You're my heartbeat, I'm breathing because of you

There's no world without us
Dreams would turn into dust
You're the reason, the reason I make it through

Feels like I'm flying, like if I had wings
Like I am sailing on a sea of dreams
You're love is pouring down on me, you're my
Waterfall

In a moment like this
I'm in a state of bliss
I'm swept away, I look into an open sky

Feels like I'm flying, like if I had wings
Like I am sailing on a sea of dreams
You're love is pouring down on me, you're my
Waterfall

My heart is higher than the highest kite
I feel how all your love surrounds me
Standing in a waterfall

Feels like I'm flying, like if I had wings
Like I am sailing on a sea of dreams
Your love is pouring like a waterfall
Over me, waterfall"

Look well behind you.
And it will be me. You made me cry a lot.
My neck still bears your claw.
I loved exchanging skin.
Our limits are a classic.
I loved our toxic love.
The one makes everything beautiful. I’ll make you hell.
From where you get lost.
Look well behind you. I’ll make you hell.
From where you get lost.
Look well behind you.
And it will be me. I’ll make you hell.

Except that we need.
Renounce the battles. I’ll make you hell.

I know that if the sky would fall
I'd survive it all because of you

[Verse 2]
I reach for the horizon
Whenever I've got days of doubt
Bringing me down
So even if disaster strikes I close my eyes and then I'm next to you
I'm right there with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Isn't it crazy
Isn't it crazy
It's all because of you
All because of you

[Chorus]
It's all because of you
All because of you
I know that if the sky would fall
I'd survive it all because of you

[Bridge]
It's all cause of you, because of you
Because of you
It's all cause of you
I know that if the sky would fall, I'd survive it all
Because of you

[Chorus]
It's all because of you
All because of you
I know that if the sky would fall
I'd survive it all because of you"
L'essenziale,"the heroes state
if the game gets hard, you have to play it
lucky them
if they confuse the offences with the good thing.
It also happens to us
to fight and then strive for peace
and in my silence
I take all your sorrow away
to appreciate everything that I couldn't choose While the world breaks into pieces
I compose new places and desires which
also belongs to you
from the beginning you are for me
the essential thing I won't accept
another error in valuation
love is capable of
hiding itself behind friendly words
which I have spoken before
they became empty and stupid While the world breaks into pieces
I compose new places and desires which
also belongs to you
from the beginning you are for me while the world breaks into pieces
I take distance from the excesses
and from the bad habits
I will return to the origins
I return to you, who is for me
the essential thing love doesn't follow the logic
it takes away your breath and your thirst while the world breaks into pieces
I compose new places and desires which
also belongs to you while the world breaks into pieces
I take distance of the excesses
and from the bad habits
I will return to the origins
I return to you, who is for me
the essential thing"
Not Alone,"You're all alone, you're all alone
No shoulder wants you to lean on
You thought this world was too cold
And you've made up
A whole new world

Don't cry, don't cry, little bird
Though you are scared and you're hurt
You're gonna wake up
It's only a dream
And why do dreams make people scream

You're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone

You're not alone
You're not alone

What if it's all in one kiss
That turns all seeds into trees, yeah
The strongest wind into breeze
Enter all doors without keys, yeah

What if it's all in one kiss
That turns all seeds into trees
The strongest wind into breeze, yeah
What if it's all in one kiss

You're not alone
You're not alone"
Cake to Bake,"I melted the ice of the polar caps
Found the raiders of the lost ark
Solved a case for the genius from Baker Street
Helped to clean the Central Park
I created the plan for the Chinese wall
Went to desert, made it rain
Swam through a shark tank bloodily
Found Atlantis, by the way
But today

I’ve got a cake to bake, and got no clue at all
I’ve got a cake to bake, and haven’t done that before
Don’t be proud, mate, please, don’t bother
Go, come on and ask your mother
How to bake, how to bake, bake that cake

Cep cep cep cep cep kuuku kuuku cep cep cep cep cep cep kuuku
Cep cep cep cep cep kuuku kuuku cep cep cep cep cep cep kuuku

I talked to a unicorn the other night
Took me up on a lonely star
Did the moonwalk on the milky way
Realized I’ve gone too far
So I questioned the law of gravity
Put the apple back up to the apple tree
Ej tu nost: I even learned Latvian
I know it’s so hard to believe
But today

I’ve got a cake to bake, and got no clue at all
I’ve got a cake to bake, and haven’t done that before
Don’t be proud, mate, please, don’t bother
Go, come on and ask your mother
How to bake, how to bake, bake that cake (piece of cake)

We’ve got a cake to bake, and haven’t done that before
Don’t be proud, mate, please, don’t bother
Go, come on and ask your mother
How to bake, how to bake, bake that cake (piece of cake)

Mix some dough, add some love, let it bake, wait for it
Mix some dough, add some love, let it bake, wait for it
Mix some dough, add some love, let it bake, have some cake
Mix some dough, add some love, let it bake

We’ve got a cake to bake, and got no clue at all
We’ve got a cake to bake, and haven’t done that before
Don’t be proud, mate, please, don’t bother

How to bake, how to bake, bake that cake"
Amazing,"Remember how we used to be
Floating the skies, it felt so heavenly
We were weightless
We froze to ice and melted down
We chased the stars and felt to the ground
Couldn't care less

This feeling inside
You're all that I have, I need you back
Do you hear me screaming?

Stay amazing lie (Do you hear me screaming?)
Stay amazing lie (Do you hear me screaming?)
I don't, don't want another to make me high
I want, want you to be amazing lie
Stay amazing lie

You know there's nothing I wouldn't do
I'd brake the curse of time to be with you
I'd be fearless
I'd jump as far as I can see
And beat the perfect storm in the endless sea

This feeling inside
You're all that I have, I need you back
Do you hear me screaming?

Stay amazing lie (Do you hear me screaming?)
Stay amazing lie (Do you hear me screaming?)
I don't, don't want another to make me high
I want, want you to be amazing lie
Stay amazing lie

This feeling inside
You're all that i have, i need you back
We were weightless

Stay amazing lie (Do you hear me screaming?)
Stay amazing lie (Do you hear me screaming?)
I don't, don't want another to make me high
I want, want you to be amazing lie
Stay amazing lie"
Undo,"[Verse 1]
Silent, I can't wait here silent
Working up a storm inside my head
Nothing, I just stood for nothing
So I fell for everything you said

[Pre-Chorus]
Hear the rumble
Hear my voice

[Verse 2]
Silent, I can't wait here silent
Gotta make a change
And make some noise

[Chorus]
Undo my sad
Undo what hurts so bad
Undo my pain
Gonna get out, through the rain
I know that I am over you
At last, I know what I should do
Undo my sad love

[Verse 3]
Trouble, baby, I'm in trouble
Every time I look into your eyes
Save me, oh, I'm gonna save me
Far away from all the crazy lies

Hear the rumble
Hear my voice

Undo my sad
Undo what hurts so bad
Undo my pain
Gonna get out, through the rain
I know that I am over you
At last, I know what I should do
Undo my sad

Undo what hurts so bad
Undo my pain
Gonna get out, through the rain
I know that I am over you
At last, I know what I should do

One Night's Anger,"Say no, let go, keep your breath, as the anger flows
I Know, you know, words can hurt, you’ll regret them though
So say say say say you’ll be there when the words are done
Don’t give in your pride
Keep calm and think twice

Free your mind from the doubts that are tickling
Free your heart, and let the peace enlighten your feelings
Sun will rise, and the light will be clearing
The tides of the night
Keep calm and think twice

Say no, let go, night will fade and the day will glow
I know, you know, that the morning is brighter so
Please say say say say you’ll be there when the words are done
Don’t give in your pride
Let go and don’t cry

Free your mind from the doubts that are tickling
Free your heart, and let the peace enlighten your feelings
Sun will rise, and the light will be clearing
The tides of the night
Keep calm and think twice

Wait a tick tiny tick, you’ll regret it (just wanna say it right)
Wait a tick tiny tick; you’ll forget it (I want to let it out)
Anything isn’t it you want to get it
Maybe tomorrow, will be late to get by"
Shine,"Been looking at the sky, wishing on a star
Waiting for a brand new start
Living on the edge, closer to the crime
Cross the line a step at a time

Now maybe there’s a place, maybe there’s a time
Maybe there’s a day you’ll be mine
Now something’s gotta give, make a brighter day
All we got to say

Shine into my darkness
Shine into the night, my rising sun
Drive away the madness
Can you be a masterpiece of love?

Sending out a message up above
Telling all the world to show some love
No one’s gonna bring me down, bring me down
You’re my rising sun

Keep looking up ahead, riding like the wind
Open up your heart, let me in
My life is on a string when I see you smile
Our love will last a thousand miles

Now maybe there’s a place, maybe there’s a time
Maybe there’s a day you’ll be mine
Now something’s gotta give, make a brighter day
All we got to say

Shine into my darkness
Shine into the night, my rising sun
Drive away the madness

Start a Fire,"Someone’s selling garden roses down the square
People gathering by to breathe the morning air
But no one sees the bitter cold and shivering empty hands

A school girl running by and trying to beat the bell
People dropping, tossing coins in wishing wells
But no one cares for dreams that don’t fit into our world

Maybe nightfall darkens skies
And maybe teardrops stain our eyes
But may the slightest light
Start a fire

A soldier in the hands of a forgotten mess
Digging out the burning bullets in his chest
So eager, bold and noble – printing footsteps on this earth

And maybe nightfall darkens skies
Maybe teardrops stain our eyes
But may the slightest light
Start a fire, start a fire

But may the slightest light
Start a fire"
Tick-Tock,"I believe that I’ve loved you
Since the first time that I saw you
Bells rang, angels sang
When the light of the night fell on us we knew

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

We both knew that you were mine
Now cover me, I’ll buy us time, time
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Tick-tock, can you hear me go tick-tock?
My heart is like a clock, I’m steady like a rock
Shh, don’t stop, kiss and kiss me till I drop
My heart is like a clock, you wind it with your love

Tick-tock, can you hear me go tick-tock?
My heart is like a clock, I’m steady like a rock
Shh, don’t stop, kiss and kiss me till I drop
My heart is like a clock, you wind it with your love

Now I know it’s too hard to
Go tick-tock without the glimpse of you
If you cave in I break
I keep losing my pace in this endless race

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

They all know that you’re mine
They can see we belong
Shelter me, you’ll do fine
Wait for me, I’ll buy us time

Tick-tock, can you hear me go tick-tock?
My heart is like a clock, I’m steady like a rock
Shh, don’t stop, kiss and kiss me till I drop
My heart is like a clock, you wind it with your love

Tick-tock, can you hear me go tick-tock?
My heart is like a clock, I’m steady like a rock
Shh, don’t stop, kiss and kiss me till I drop
(My heart is like a clock) Oh, you wind it with your love…

Mother,"I’m coming home
I’m broken-hearted and I need time to shelter
I need your love, a hand to hold
A heart to heal a voice to help me through, through

When hope is low
You find the words to make me feel so much better
When I’ve had enough, I’ve had enough of all the tears
And all the hurt I can count on you, only you

And once again, Mother
You are right there, Mother
You are my guiding light
My shoulder, my shelter, my satellite
I’m weak, you’re bright

It’s not said enough
But you mean the world to me, you’re more than a soulmate
And you should know, oh you should know
I’m so hopeful and so thankful that someday soon
I’ll shine like you

And once again, Mother
You are right there, Mother
You are my guiding light
My shoulder, my shelter, my satellite
I’m weak, you’re bright

Give me your strength, Mother
Give me your care, Mother
You are my guiding light
My shoulder, my shelter, my satellite
I’m weak, you’re bright

And once again, Mother
And once again, Mother
Ooh Mother"
Wild Soul,"What am I?
Am I human?
What am I?
An emotion?
Time and space can lie to us while we sleep
Lovers cry, parents tremble
While you and I show our devils
The world can play a joke on each of us anytime

Mercy
I have no feelings of mercy
Destiny left me so empty
Empty in my heart and my spirit
My patience fighting with our indifference
Fighting to win over everything
That we are and can be

Selfishness takes the trophies
Honesty wins the glories
All the masks we have are meant to make us free
Wounded pride kills our feeling
While you and I need the dreaming
The world can throw a dice for each of us anytime

Mercy
I have no feelings of mercy
Destiny left me so empty
Empty in my heart and my spirit
My patience fighting with our indifference
Fighting to win over everything
That we are and can be

Wild soul
Is rushing through my body
And my
Wild soul
Is meant to keep me trying

Mercy
I have no feelings of mercy
Destiny left me so empty
Empty in my heart and my spirit
My patience fighting with our indifference
Fighting to win over everything
That we are and can be"
Maybe,"Maybe there's a pearl in the shell
Maybe there's a story to tell
Maybe we cannot live in peace
'Cause we're under a spell

Maybe there's a light from above
Maybe there's a flight of a dove
When it's time
To open the heart of love

Maybe we can try, maybe you and I
Are finding pain to overcome
Maybe then one day
Every soul heals and will find a way

And maybe we really are the dream of God
And we woke up in flesh and blood
With our emotion transformed into gold

Or maybe in certain solid ways I feel
I know there's nothing stronger and more real
Than falling in love

Maybe you and I are teardrops from the sky
That fill the sea eternally
Maybe we can try
To challenge the fear of the endless night

And maybe we really are the dream of God
And we woke up in flesh and blood
To find our bodies transformed into gold

Or maybe in certain solid ways I feel
I know there's nothing stronger and more real
Than falling in love

Maybe it's a journey in the darkest night
Maybe we can make it to the morning light
Maybe this is it, this is real
And I feel this is right, finally right

And maybe the courage that I'm finding now
Remembering and sensing how we fell in love"

Calm After the Storm,"[Verse 1]
Driving in a fast lane
Counting mile marker signs
The empty seat beside me
Keeps you on my mind
Livin’ in the heartache
Was never something I pursued
I can’t keep on chasing
What I can’t be for you

[Chorus]
Oooh, skies are black and blue
Thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm

[Verse 2]
Tears on a highway
Water in my eyes
This rain ain’t gonna change us
So what’s the use to cry
I could say I’m sorry
But I don’t wanna lie
I just wanna know if staying
Is better than goodbye

[Chorus]
Oooh, skies are black and blue
I'm thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm

[Post-Chorus]
Oooh, after all that we’ve been through
There ain’t nothin’ new
Here in the calm after the storm

[Bridge]
Maybe I can find you
Down this broken line
Maybe you can find me
I guess we’ll know in time

Oooh, skies are black and blue
Thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm

There ain’t nothing new
Here in the calm after the storm"

As it wrote your happiness for someone else
Know that I still love you

In my world to get you back
So you give me the glory
With you I only know to love I keep my world for you
In my world, I seek to get you back

So the dawn breaks
With you I only know to love Know that I still love you
In my heart there is only you
I still keep for us

Running,"Silent cries every night
This pain don’t ever leave her life
Daddy’s home, so she tries to hide
She calls for Mom, but never a reply

She cries, cries, cries, she’s all alone
Daddy why, why, why? Leave me alone
She calls for help, she calls for help but no one seems to care
She calls for help but no one seems to care

She keeps on running, running, running from this crazy life
She keeps on running, running, running, never sees the light
I can see the angels standing by your side
It’ll be alright

She’s back again just one more time
Just wants to see her mother smile
She can’t forget her only child
Mama let the devil in her house

She cries, cries, cries, she’s all alone

Coming Home,"Freedom of life, I will express my soul

Whoah, I’m coming home

I’m not holding back, no, I ain’t wasting time
If you want me near then you must come for the ride
If your sky will fall, I’ll shelter you from the rain

I'm not an animal in captivity

I'm skinning you out

I'm, skinning you out
No longer apart
We don't beat from the same heart
We don't beat from the same heart

מתוך מילים
נוצרה דממה

עכשיו לקום בלי חשש
לבחור מחדש
והשמש תתגלה אולי
זמן לפקוח עיני
להושיט את ידיי
לחופש הקורא אליי

זמן ללכת ממך
יותר לא שלך
לא תשמע אותי בוכה
זמן, לקום ולבחור
שמיים ואור
אין מקום לחשכה

And its for me to clean your up your mess
I will take it without any regrets
And its for me to open my eyes
And to recognize
We dont beat from the same heart

I'm skinning you out
No longer apart
We don't beat from the same heart
I'm, skinning you out
No longer apart
We don't beat from the same heart
We don't beat from the same heart"
Silent Storm,"Head to toe
Flesh and bones?
Should feel whole
But the void
A silent storm?

I’m here to use my heart and my hands
Somehow the bruises changed my plans?

And there’s a silent storm inside me
Looking for a home
I hope that someone’s gonna find me
And say that I belong
I’ll wait forever and a lifetime
To find I’m not alone
There’s a silent storm inside me
And someday I’ll be calm
Someday I’ll be calm

Ask myself
What comes next
Will I fly??
Will I fall?
My silent storm?

I’m here to use my heart and my hands ?
Somehow the bruises changed my plans?

And there’s a silent storm inside me
Looking for a home
I hope that someone’s gonna find me
And say that I belong
I’ll wait forever and a lifetime
To find I’m not alone
And there’s a silent storm inside me
Someday I’ll be calm

And someday I’ll be calm
And someday I’ll be calm"

Rock the boat of ragged despair

Hear the chime, now’s the time
Three minutes time to Earth for you and me
Take our breath away as we fly

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lo lo hey…

Anytime, anywhere, We are going (Shin)"

Rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes
Seeking rather than vengeance, retribution
You were warned
Once I'm transformed, once I’m reborn
You know I will rise like a phoenix
But you're my flame

[Verse 2]
Go about your business
Act as if you’re free
No one could have witnessed
What you did to me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Cause you wouldn’t know me today
And you have got to see
To believe
From the fading light, I fly

[Chorus]
Rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes
Seeking rather than vengeance, retribution
You were warned
Once I'm transformed, once I’m reborn

[Bridge]
I rise up to the sky
You threw me down but
I'm gonna fly

[Chorus]
And rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes
Seeking rather than vengeance, retribution
You were warned
Once I'm transformed, once I’m reborn
You know I will rise like a phoenix
But you’re my flame"
Attention,"Attention!

Did you think that you can get me, boy? (no)
Think again, babe
Thought you could buy me for a drink or two,
But I'm not that easy

You saw me chattin' with my girls at bar (true)
We're all pretty

You thought I'd give it to you all I have (wait)
Not the first night

You said that it might be the love at first sight (babe)
Hold your horses
You told me you're the best I'll ever have,
But I just don't believe...

Something Better,"Even human bound, people rolling dice
Image on the ground, such a novel life, he thought
While knowing nothing at all

Every option noted or tendency made
They will carry on until the perfect date, she said
While knowing nothing at all

All the rules wide known, they mean nothing to me
Everything I’m used to seems to be
Fine, misshapen, made up fantasy
Should let go, should let go

But we found something better
Plain answer however
For I’ll not surrender
We found something better

Vis-à-vis, estranged, and we got close
Trust full of lies, sure how it goes, they told
While knowing nothing at all

Talking loud ’bout future in our hands
Exchanging dreams and how they’ll last, no no
Still knowing nothing at all

But we found something better
Plain answer however
For I’ll not surrender
We found something better

All these words reflected back to me
All these words I’m buying why?
All these words, the lives’ grand mystery
All these words a sweet white lie

All these words she meant to say to me
All these words against my faith
All these words before she passed away
All these words we’ll never, never, never change

We found something better
Plain answer however
For I’ll not surrender
We found something better

We found (Something better)
We found (Something better)
We found (Something better)
We found, we found, we found, we found, we found"
Heartbeat,"White lightning upon us again
The walls’ now paper-thin
And soon the sun’s breaking in
Don’t you know? Know

How the world is not always true
Still my truth will remain in you
We’ll be braver when we start anew
I know, I know

Ooh, when the ocean’s way too deep

Keep your head high above the water
We can make it and break the border
Hold on to my heartbeat
My heartbeat, my heartbeat

Face the danger and face tomorrow
You’re a dreamer and you don’t know
That no story’s carved in stone
Just hold on to my heartbeat, my heartbeat

The ground may be caving in
And some wounds, they may never mend
But we will rise up and try again
I know, I know

Ooh, when the shore is hard to see

Keep your head high above the water
We can make it and break the border
Hold on to my heartbeat
My heartbeat, my heartbeat

Face the danger and face tomorrow
You’re a dreamer and you don’t know
That no story’s carved in stone
Just hold on to my heartbeat, my heartbeat

Keep your head high above the water
We can make it and break the border
Hold on to my heartbeat
My heartbeat, my heartbeat

Face the danger and face tomorrow
You’re a dreamer and you don’t know
That no story’s carved in stone
Just hold on to my heartbeat, my heartbeat"
Cheesecake,"Yeah, baby

Once I gave you one more chance
You showed me dance
But I’m not Patrick Swayze
You’re not Jennifer Gray

I told this story
But I’m so sorry
I lost my train of thought

Hey, I will fly far away
By any plane

Don’t stay, on my way, hey

You dial my number
Your dreams start crumbling
You want me to be the man
I’ll never, ever be

To the Sky,"I’ve got a feeling that I wanna go loud
Make my move and let it all get out
I’ve got a feeling that I wanna go wild
Take my hand, baby I got all night

Take me now, you know I want you
Hold me now, ’cause I can’t stop it
Take me up, where we can do this
To the stars tonight

Where do we go now?
To the sky, you and I, beautiful
Where do we go now?
To the stars, shine so bright and through the sky
Where do we go now?

Where, where do we go?
Where, where do we go?

You make me free and that is why you’re all mine

Held together by the hand of life

Hold me now, ’cause I can’t stop it
Take me up, where we can do this
To the stars tonight

Where do we go now?
To the sky, you and I, beautiful

To the stars, shine so bright and through the sky

Now I don’t wanna live without you for another day
And if I’ve said it twice it means that you will have to stay
You better hold me, dance me, sway like this forever
Take me dancing tonight

Take me now, you know I want you
Hold me now, ’cause I can’t stop it now

Hunter of Stars,"[Verse 1]
Looking for a candidate
You have an option, only one choice
Sipping my drinks, looking around
There’s so much beauty, oh, yes we can

But yet self-confidence is a fragile concept
That often fades away in the night
And there it comes, that unwanted guest
There is no place for you tonight

[Chorus]
Want me to go, want me to go
‘Cause you think I’m lying, ’cause you think I’m lying
No, open the door
‘Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no

[Verse 2]
Like an evil satellite
Twisting the truth then leaving us alone
In this mad and moody world
Society without love

I state my heart has been well trained
I’m gonna be your candidate
I am the hunter and you are the prey
Tonight I’m gonna eat you up

[Chorus]
Want me to go, want me to go
‘Cause you think I’m lying, ’cause you think I’m lying
No, open the door
‘Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars

[Bridge]
I press my nose to the glass
It’s raining outside, it’s raining outside
I would like to storm in
Roar like a lion, roar like a lion

But I fear your judgement, oh, I fear your judgement
I’m so wet, I’m dirty
But I fear your judgement, oh, I fear your judgement
It’s me and my imperfection

[Chorus] [x3]
Want me to go, want me to go
‘Cause you think I’m lying, ’cause you think I’m lying
No, open the door
‘Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no"
Rise Up,"I feel like rising up
To the sky like I am a dove
I’m in love with this feeling…
Am I down or am I up?
I can’t frown cause I am in luck
I’ve got the crowd and that’s enough…
I’m in love

Come on and rise up; rise up to the sky
Come on and rise up!
Get up and lose your mind!
Loosen up your feet and fly......
Get off the ground tonight.....

I’m gonna show you how to live
(I’m gonna hold your heart in hand)
Yeah I’m gonna make you understand

You don’t know, you don’t know, is it love, is it hate?
What are you changing? (What are we doing?)
You don’t know, you don’t, but can you feel it inside?
Feel the roses, feel the pride (Can you believe it?)

Round and round again we…
Round and round again we go… oh-oh…
Round and round again we…
Round and round again we go… oh-oh…

Is a moment just a circle
Just a song you play on repeat?
If we can’t change how we’re living
Isn’t life just a lie that we feed?

And now I’m gonna show you how to breathe
I’m gonna show you how to live
(I’m gonna hold your heart in hand)
Yeah I’m gonna make you understand

You don’t know, you don’t know, is it love, is it hate?
What are you changing? (What are we doing?)
You don’t know, you don’t, but can you feel it inside?
Feel the roses, feel the pride (Can you believe it?)

Ko nebo ne bo prekrilo najinih sanj
Prerojena (Bova spoznala)
Ko nebo ne bo imelo pravih idej

Kar je bilo, oh-oh…
Le srce bo tisto ki ne bo več isto
Kar je bilo, vse kar je bilo"
Miracle,"I don't know if it's right
But I've got a feeling
And want to believe this is magical
Is this what it's like
Cause I'm starting to feel it
And I want to believe it's incredible

If you only knew all the things I could tell you
We could be dancing with stars in the night

It's so magical, so magical
So beautiful, So beautiful

It's a Miracle!
It's a Miracle!
I can see it now!

All the things I see
I think I see them too
All for you and me
It's like a dream come true
It's so beautiful
No one will ever know
It's a miracle

Now you know that I'm right
And you got that feeling
I told you before that it's magical
Yes, it's magical
Now you know what it's like
And you're starting to feel it
But you just can't deny it's incredible

If I only knew all the things you could tell me
We could be dancing with stars in the night

It's a Miracle!
It's a Miracle!
I can see it now!

All the things I see
I think I see them too
All for you and me

Is It Right,"[Intro]
(Is it right? Is it right?)
(Is it right? Is it right?)

[Verse 1]
He's got a pen in his hand
A piece of paper staring back
He could write like a man
A novel life, back on track

Maybe a drama or a poem
But still he doesn't, no
The time is ticking in his ear
The holy silence disappears

[Chorus]
Is it right or is it wrong?
I can't go on, you can't go on
If you say yes or even no
You don't know how and where to go
Is it right or is it wrong?
I can't go on, you can't go on
If you say yes or even no
You don't know how and where to go

(Is it right? Is it right?)

[Verse 2]
She turns over and looks to him
She tries to feel; she can't feel anything
But it's so hard to say goodbye
When you know that it's right

So when it's all not what you thought
And the friendship is not enough
When you long to feel alive
And take the chance to give it up

[Chorus]
Is it right or is it wrong?
I can't go on, you can't go on
If you say yes or even no
You don't know how and where to go
Is it right or is it wrong?
I can't go on, you can't go on
If you say yes or even no
You don't know how and where to go

[Bridge]
I know it's not easy to decide
To find your own direction
Oh, the risk is high
But you can't hide

(Is it right? Is it right?)

[Chorus]
Is it right or is it wrong?
I can't go on, you can't go on
If you say yes or even no
You don't know how and where to go
Is it right or is it wrong?
I can't go on, you can't go on
If you say yes or even no
You don't know how and where to go

Is it right or is it wrong?
I can't go on, you can't go on..."
Moustache,"Something is missing, but what?
I want this, I want that
When I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming in dollars,
every day I'm wearing a different suit. At my place everything is new, everything is beautiful,
the world is crying behind my curtains
I don't care, I'm living on the last floor
I don't even know my cleaning lady. There's leather in my car,
the smell of my perfume reassures me
I don't like showing my emotions
at the gym I'm lifting some weights and barbells,
my body is a war machine
I have everything one could ever dream of
I may have everything, true, but I wanted a moustache,
a moustache I want this, I want that
there's never enough for me
it's like this, it's like that
there's always something I don't have So I keep adding more,
tons of stuff in my closet
I have friends too
even some who like me I tell myself I've got everything to please
I got everything, I got
the world at my feet (It's crazy)
I have everything one could ever dream of
I may have everything, true, but I wanted a moustache,
a moustache I want this, I want that
there's never enough for me
it's like this, it's like that
there's always something I don't have I'd give everything I have
for a moustache
Now I know
what I want is
a moustache I could abandon everything
give away everything
for a moustache
I may have everything, true
but not what I really wanted I want this, I want that
there's never enough for me
it's like this, it's like that
there's always something I don't have Moustache"
La mia città,"I hate the rushing, the sounds, the fog and the hung time of this city,
I hate the heeled shoes with which, because of my inattention, I get stuck in the intrusive manholes of this city,
I hate myself in the mirror, not because I've got flaws, but because I'm stupid,
I love being outside, knowing that I'll always come back to this city And tell me if there is any sense to this time, to my useless wandering
And tell me if there is really a destination or I'll have to run away in order to be happy And I run, run forward and I come back,
I get away, I want, I take and shiver,
Hugging your breath strongly
And I think of me that I can't stop,
I push hard and I'm not afraid of you,
I want everything, I want you,
I want you, I want you, I want you I love the traffic in the centre, parking while being distracted, your smile and my instability,
I love pretending I'm offended, without any reason, and then making peace in the evening, you turn off the city
And I irrationally love myself for this, because of my being self-centred,
I love teasing you, knowing that I'll always come back to this city And tell me if there is any sense to this time, to my useless wandering
And tell me if there is really a destination or I'll have to run away in order to be happy And I run, run forward and I come back,
I get away, I want, I take and shiver,
Hugging your breath strongly
And I think of me that I can't stop,
I push hard and I'm not afraid of you,
I want everything, I want you,
I want you, I want you, I want you And tell me if you want it
And tell me that you aren't
Just a confused reflection
That I look upon at the bottom of ""us"" And I run, run forward and I come back,
I get away, I want, I take and shiver,
Hugging your breath strongly
And I think of me that I can't stop,
I push hard and I'm not afraid of you,
I want everything, I want you,
I want you, I want you, I want you I want you, I want you, I want you"
Dancing in the Rain,"[Verse 1:]

Power to the people (oh, oh, oh, oh)

I've been tired of this thinking (hey)
So I've drowned it out with drinking (oh)
Tastes like a bitter pill but I'll just wash it down
With the taste of something sweet that some doctor gave me now
And this is a madness
I'm not giving in

We're shining like diamonds
With fire in our bones
Standing beside you I've a feeling that I'll never walk alone

We're children of the universe, don't you know
Dancing on the edge of time and it's ours to own
Just children of the universe

Power to the people (oh, hey, hey)
Power to the people (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Power to the people (oh, hey, hey)
You know what we want and we've gotta get it now

Something's stirring in the silence (hey, hey)
And it reeks of passive violence (oh)
Hold on tight this opportunity we'll take, put an end to all this suffering before it gets too late
Hopes on the horizon
I'm not giving in

We're children of the universe don't you know
Dancing on the edge of time and it's ours to own
Just children of the universe

We're shining like diamonds
With love in our hearts
They said it's the end but I've a feeling
It might just be the start
As I am awakened with fire in my bones
Standing beside you I've a feeling that I'll never walk alone

We're children of the uni, children of the uni
Children of the universe don't you know
Yeah dancing on the edge of time and it's ours to own

Sky-high while you pull me under
Cause you got what I want, what I want
What I want want want want (I want your love)
Yeah baby let me show ya (show ya)
You got me trippin’ over (over)
Cause you got what I want, what I want
What I want want want
I want your love (I want your love)
Nothing can steal your thunder
Sky-high while you pull me under
Cause you got what I want, what I want
What I want want want want
Yeah baby let me show ya (show ya)
You got me trippin’ over (over)
Cause you got what I want, what I want
What I want want want
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love

Face the Shadow,"[Verse 1]
We find so many ways fooling our heart
Playing too many games trying to hide
When you follow a dream, surrender the sorrow inside
Face every shadow you denied
Feels like so many times life was unfair
Will you run and forget all the despair?
If it’s breaking you down, remember the power inside
Face every shadow you denied

[Pre-Chorus]
Time is ticking and you keep thinking that you are tricking your heart
So

[Chorus]
Don’t deny
Ever don’t deny
Baby don’t deny
You and I

[Verse 2]
Cross the ocean of blues, happy you'll be
Оnce you’ve risen, you are meant to be free
When you're feeling afraid remember there's hope inside
Face every shadow purified

[Pre-Chorus]
Time is ticking and you keep thinking that you are tricking your heart
So

[Chorus]
Don’t deny
Ever don’t deny
Listen don’t deny (I don’t want to deny)
You and I

Don’t deny
Ever don’t deny
Listen don’t deny
Don't deny you and I"
Rhythm Inside,"[Verse 1]
Listen to the sound of thunder
Rolling in the soul down under
Far beneath the skin, it rumbles
Step to the step of the drum that rolls inside
Be your enemy or lover
We are put here to discover
The heart that beats within each other
We gonna ra-pa-pap, ra-pa-pap
We gonna ra-pa-pap tonight

[Chorus]
And if we die tomorrow
What do we have to show
For the wicked ways down below
The rhythm inside is telling us
We can fly tomorrow
On the beautiful wind that blows
On a cosmic track, love attack
I‘m gonna get that rhythm back

[Verse 2]
Be your enemy or brother
We were put here to discover
The heart that beats within each other
We gonna ra-pa-pap, ra-pa-pap
We gonna ra-pa-pap tonight

[Chorus]
And if we die tomorrow
What do we have to show
For the wicked ways down below
The rhythm inside is telling us
We can fly tomorrow

On a cosmic track, love attack

Walk Along,"I open up my heart to you
And cry for your attention
Still you haven’t seen it yet
You only see me as a friend
But I wish you were waiting
With roses in sunset, yeah

Why, why-aiaiai, why-aiaiai
Won’t you walk along, walk along, baby
Why, why-aiaiai, why-aiaiai
Won’t you walk along, walk along, baby

I’m begging you take me
Wherever you have gone
Come back and save me
Don’t want to be alone
Nothing left, I just have
One last breath

I’ m begging you take me
Out of this firing hell
Come back and save me
What happened wasn’t fair
Nothing left all that I have
Is one last breath
Only one last breath


Just pain, fake love and drunken lie
Ι struggle to survive, I’m still alive
I’m fighting tears and fears apart
But still it’s dark, inside my heart

[Refrain]
I’m begging you take me
Wherever you have gone
Come back and save me
Don’t want to be alone
Nothing left, I just have
One last breath"
Goodbye to Yesterday,"[Verse 1: Stig Rästa]
I woke up at 6AM
My eyes were closed but my mind was awake
Pretended I was breathing in a deep sleep pace
Got dressed so quietly
I was frozen by the jingle of my keys at the door
As I got outside, I smiled to the dog

[Chorus: Stig Rästa and Elina Born]
I didn’t wanna wake you up
My love was never gonna be enough
So I took my things and got out of your way now girl
Why didn’t you wake me up?
I’m pretty sure I would have told you to stop
Lets try again and say goodbye
Goodbye to yesterday

[Verse 2: Elina Born]
Why would you think like that?
Yeah we fight a lot but in the end
You and I we’re a perfect match
I wouldn’t want it any other way
But now your gone and I’m all alone
Lying here naked and staring at the phone

[Chorus: Stig Rästa and Elina Born]
I didn’t wanna wake you up
My love was never gonna be enough
So I took my things and got out of your way now girl
Why didn’t you wake me up?
I’m pretty sure I would have told you to stop
Lets try again and say goodbye
Goodbye to yesterday

I didn’t wanna wake you up
My love was never gonna be enough
So I took my things and got out of your way now girl
Why didn’t you wake me up?
I’m pretty sure I would have told you to stop
Lets try again and say goodbye
Goodbye to yesterday

[Outro: Elina Born]
Goodbye to yesterday
Oh, goodbye to yesterday"
Autumn Leaves,"Met in the dark of night you were my lucky strike crazy kids with out a clue;
Hanging from our knees up in the willow trees easy like the month of June;
A fairytale gone right with no ending in sight had me tangled up in blue;
You said we'd never change but maybe we do...
Baby this is all we ever used to know
But I can see your colours change to red and gold

[Refrain]
Every moment will hurt;
From the last to the ﬁrst;
And I'm trying ﬁnd a way to breathe;
Close the book and the chapter forever and after;
I'm falling like the autumn leaves;
My heart is beating like a million drums;
Cuz your the ground under my feet;
I'm trying to hold on but baby I'm falling free;
Like the autumn leaves

Baby this is all we ever used to know
But I can see your colours change to red and gold

[Refrain]
Every moment will hurt;
From the last to the ﬁrst;
And I'm trying ﬁnd a way to breathe;
Close the book and the chapter forever and after;
I'm falling like the autumn leaves;
My heart is beating like a million drums;
Cuz your the ground under my feet;
I'm trying to hold on but baby I'm falling free;
Like the autumn leaves"
Beauty Never Lies,"[Verse 1]
In a shadowy world lived a dazzling girl
Unaware of the light she’d imprisoned inside
Took a million mistakes to lead her to daybreak
But she made it through, now I know the truth

[Chorus]
Beauty never lies, never hides, never gives a damn
Beauty never lies, no, it cries “Here I am!”
Finally I can say ""Yes, I’m different and it’s okay!""
Here I am

[Verse 2]
Had to shatter the fears laughing in the mirror
Undermining me, now at last I see

[Chorus]
Beauty never lies, never hides, never gives a damn
Beauty never lies, no, it cries “Here I am”
Finally I can say ""Yes, I’m different and it’s okay""
Here I am, here I am

[Bridge]
Ohhhh, ohhhhh!
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, woo!

Beneath the veil of skin the heart’s entangled in
Beauty’s embodied
Beneath the mask of shame, my soul is set aflame, ohh

[Chorus]
Beauty never lies
Beauty never lies
Finally I can say ""Yes, I’m different and it’s okay""
Here I am, here I am"
Wars for Nothing,"Do you know our earth is a mess
All the wars for nothing, it never ends
Everybody deserves a chance
All the souls, all the souls, can you hear them cry?

That you live in peace does not mean
It’s okay to ignore all the pain
I see children joining the stars
Soldiers walk towards the dark, let me ask

Can you justify all the eyes
That will never see daylight
Give me one good reason to hurt
A helpless soul, break a heart, kill a mind

Do you know how many innocents
Are hiding from punishment
For crimes they’d never commit
All alone, all alone, do they deserve

To die for believing something else
For having a face someone can’t stand
Do you know our earth is a mess
All the wars for nothing, it never ends
All the souls, all alone, hold them tight
All the souls, deserve a chance at life"
Time,"[Verse 1]
Tell me where I belong
I've been trying for so long
Breaking out through the night
Made me see the bright light
Now I'm willing to fight
And I know that time is on my side

[Chorus]
Time is like thunder, ah-ah
Hear it like thunder, ah-ah
All we've got are some days
And I am tryna' not to waste
Time is like thunder, ah-ah
Beating like thunder in our heads
Time is like thunder, ah-ah, ah-ah,ah-ah

[Verse 2]
At the end of your rope
Keep on hoping against all hope, oh
Time is fading away
So don't you lose a day
We can do what we say

[Bridge]
(Time is like thunder)
(Time is like thunder) I know, you know
(Time is like thunder) I don’t want to wait
(Like thunder, like thunder)
Time is like thunder aaa
Hear it like thunder aaa
Beating like thunder aaa aaa aaa

[Chorus]
Time is like thunder, ah-ah
Hear it like thunder, ah-ah
All we've got are some days
And I am tryna' not to waste
Time is like thunder, ah-ah
Beating like thunder in our heads
Time is like thunder, ah-ah, ah-ah,ah-ah
Beating like thunder
Time is like thunder ah-ah, ah-ah,ah-ah

I don’t want to wait"
A Million Voices,"We are the worlds people
Different yet we're the same
We believe
We believe in a dream

Praying for peace and healing
I hope we can start again
We believe
We believe in a dream

So if you ever feel love is fading
Together like the stars in the sky
We can sing
We can shine

[Chorus]
When you hear our voices call
You won't be lonely anymore
A million voices
Your heart is like a beating drum
Burning brighter than the sun
A million voices

Now as the world is listening
From cities and satellites
We believe
We believe
In a dream

If you ever feel love is fading
Together like the stars in the sky
We can sing
We can shine

When you hear our voices call
You won't be lonely anymore
A million voices
Your heart is like a beating drum
Burning brighter than the sun

When I look around at these faces
I can see the stars in the sky
We will sing
We will shine

The Way You Are,"Summer's here, winter's gone
Finally I can see the sun
Every time you walk into the room

And all my fears disappear
When I'm in your atmosphere
I don't know what it is you do

But you do
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But you do
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I can't explain why

It's the way you are
It's just the way that you are
That can make my day
The bad times go away

It's the way you are
It's just the way that you are
That can make my day
The bad times go away

Like an old radio
A song I just can't let go
All I got on my mind is you
Movie stars and caviar
Couldn't get me where you are
There's nothing I could do about it

It's the way you are
It's just the way that you are
That can make my day
The bad times go away

And I'll be right there
When you need someone to guide you
(Guide you)
Whatever it takes, girl
I will be doing it for you
(For you)

'Cause I've been acting like a fool
I wanna take my time and spent it all on you
So girl just come and sweep my feet off the ground
Like you do

It's the way you are
It's just the way that you are
That can make my day
The bad times go away

Hey, it's the way you are
It's just the way that you are
That can make my day
The bad times go away

Because it's all about you
Because it's all about you, girl
And I'm hanging on to every single word you say

It's the way you are
It's just the way that you are
That can make my day
The bad times go away

It's the way you are"
I'm Alive,"[Post-Chorus]
Ayeyeye
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayeyeye
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I was too afraid right from the start
To even let you welcome in my heart
You cut it deep and left it bleeding hard
Will I ever heal these painful scars?
I just can't help it
I'm out of breath, I'm trying to find the words to say
Time pass by
Now its broad daylight

[Chorus]
I know you'll come with the speed of the light
You're my everything, all that I need
You shut down my dreams but I’m not gonna cry
You live within me, that’s why I’m alive
I am alive
'Cause you are my life, you are my sun
I am alive 'cause you are my life

[Post-Chorus]
Ayeyeye
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayeyeye
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Your name is printed crystal clear on glass
From all the sighs, coming out my breath
I'm blinded by
This love can't stop screaming out your name so loud
Where are you at?
Baby won't you come back?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Wohoaa...
Please come back
Baby please come back
Wohoaa...
Baby please come back

[Chorus]
I know you'll come with the speed of the light
You're my everything, all that I need
You shut down my dreams but I’m not gonna cry
You live within me, that’s why I’m alive
I am alive
'Cause you are my life, you are my sun
I am alive 'cause you are my life

I know you'll come with the speed of the light
You're my everything, all that I need
You shut down my dreams but I’m not gonna cry
You live within me, that’s why I’m alive
I am alive

I am alive 'cause you are my life

De la capăt (All Over Again),"It is ugly at us and Dunarea dried. Why did you promise me … why don’t you come during summer? If my life was a song,
Happy, sad, I would still sing it.
I wouldn't miss a single note.
If it was a river, I would swim,
To the sea I would fallow,
I would never stop.
Remember
Life doesn't have a rewind button to
Be able to regain what you have lost,
You can’t even pause it
When you don’t know what to do. (Chorus:)
If tomorrow night would be without a star,
If the wind would continuously blow towards me,
You would be the reason; you would be the reason to be able …
To be able to start from the beginning.
If tomorrow the sky would be full of clouds,
If no sun ray would touch me in the morning,
You would be the reason; you would be the reason to be able …
To be able to start from the beginning. I have so much to tell you. The heart is like a crane,
That flies towards warmer countries
When there is winter in the soul.
Maybe will not find them,
Maybe will crash.
But will never quit,
Remember.
I would fly all night long
Towards the morning, if it was you,
The rain wouldn't be able to understand
Why I am wet without any rain drops. (Chorus:)
To be able to start from the beginning.
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
To be able to start from the beginning."

Playing with Numbers,"[Verse 1]
Do I owe you something
I think I do
They tied our hands
But I cut through

In the arms of the potion
They found our truth
And I made a girl
Abandoned you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I made the mess in your vision and
I see a debt to be paid

[Chorus]
To give a little love was all I wanted
Give a little love was all my intent
And I was playing with numbers
And I didn't know what it meant

[Verse 2]
Please don't remind me
I won't be your muse
Fragile misguided minds like mine
Only know how to use

While I played with white lies and fiction
Unbeknownst to you
I played the victim
Well that was the last time I faced you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I made the mess in your vision and
I see a debt to be paid

[Chorus]
To give a little love was all I wanted
Give a little love was all my intent
And I was playing with numbers
And I didn't know what it meant

[Bridge]
I can watch from afar from my art on my
Own all along I was lost I was wild this is
Wrong I can't force this just watch as the surface
Surrenders it all

[Pre-Chorus]
And I made the mess in your vision and
I see a debt to be paid

To give a little love was all I wanted
Give a little love was all my intent
I was playing with numbers

Adio (Адио),"The sky brought you to me,
The sky took you from me,
Still hurts me what used to hurt.
My days are the walls
My nights are the shackles (bonds)
I’m still serving you, my love. I still don’t give you to the mists of the mountains,
I still don’t give you to the depths of the water.
And you ask me to let you go, forever
To sink you into oblivion and say goodbay. Rosemary has blossomed, white lily has bent,
Everything smells like sorrow.
I try to forget, not to think of you,
But my heart is still pining for you. I still don’t give you to the mists of the mountains,
I still don’t give you to the depths of the water.
And you ask me to let you go, forever
To sink you into oblivion and say goodbye. A,a,a.... I still don’t give you to the mists of the mountains,
I still don’t give you to the depths of the water.
And you ask me to let you go, forever
To sink you into oblivion and say goodbye."
Warrior,"We Suffer, silently
Always fighting to break free

We were living in a shadow
We were to scared to let go
Wouldn't accept defeat
When by losing we were winning
We have to be courageous
To be able to get through this
And then it hits


Break through the silence
The noise is louder than it's ever been
Create something timeless
Never look back, the past is the past
I had no choice but to become a warrior
I had to conquer
I did not break, I left my faith in hope



We are not the enemy
We’re just tired of suffering


We broke through the shadow
We finally let go
And then it hit


Break through the silence
The noise is louder than it's ever been
Create something timeless
Never look back, the past is the past
I had no choice but to become a warrior
I had to conquer
I did not break, I left my faith in hope



I’m a warrior, I will conquer
I’m a warrior , I will conquer
I’m a warrior, I will conquer
I'm a warrior, I will conquer
I’m a Warrior"
A Monster Like Me,"[Verse 1: Mørland]
Honey, I'm telling the truth
I did something terrible in my early youth
My mind went blank, I lost control
I was just a little boy, I did not know

[Refrain: Mørland]
I better let you go

[Chorus: Mørland]
To find the prince you thought you found in me
I better set you free and give you up
Just wave and say goodbye and let you live
Without a monster like me

Honey, what am I to you?
Now I have pulled the trigger on this awful truth
Oh hold me now, cause I'm burning up
Sing me something beautiful, just make it stop

To find the prince you thought you found in me
I better set you free and give you up
Just wave and say goodbye and let you live

Oooh
Just go

Há um mar que nos separa,"It is three o'clock in the morning
And the rain falls down
On the streets of the city
A longing beats in my chest I see if I straighten up
But I lack the will
I'm not myself
If you're not here If it's the sea that separates us
I'll dry it with longing
And press you against my chest
A Kiss made of desire I still have
Your hands on my face
And the taste of honey
Of your mouth The night I met you
was crazy
The dawn I lost you
was sad If it's the sea that separates us
I'll dry it with longing
And press you against my chest
A Kiss made of desire If it's the sea that separates us
I'll dry it with longing
And press you against my chest
A Kiss made of desire If it's the sea that separates us"
Hope Never Dies,"Wait for me don't cross the sea of pain
Wait for me I'm lost I've gone astray
Ravens calling my name, their wings so dark
Soon they'll take me away, I have their mark
They never miss their prey

There is no light to pray for
Cold and dim are the skies
Wounded lying
Running out of life
In your eyes I could see
Our hopes and our future
Now we must let go

Find me where the night turns into day
Your love as a torch shows us the way
How to be whole again

There is no light to pray for
Cold and dim are the skies
Wounded lying
Running out of life
In your eyes I could see
Our hopes and our future
Now we must let go
Must let go, must let fade away
Or we can rise and fight

For a light to live for
Fire in our hearts
Through our pain
Through all the lies
We will walk, walk reborn
Hope never dies
Never let me go"
Golden Boy,"[Verse 1]
Mama, someone broke my heart again
Tell her I don't think I can take it anymore
Mama, someone broke my heart again
Now I'm gonna ease my pain
Dancing on the floor

[Verse 2]
Take me out
I'm not in the mood for a broken heart
Gonna dance tonight, forget her
No, she doesn’t know
What I'm doing on the floor
Did you say hello, my ladies?

[Pre-Chorus]
Pull me baby, I'm your trigger
You know that my love is bigger

Hour of the Wolf,"[Verse 1]
I hold my breath, I'm on the edge
Storming hills, I've been lost and found
I hope they're coming, I can hear them running
I once met peace, he said that he
Soon would have the answers to this hurt
And my mind was made up, I would never give up

[Chorus]
No, I won't sleep tonight
If tomorrow comes, I'll loose my mind
I won't give up my right
I know every heart deserves a fight
I will beat on the drum, rise above with me
I will go 'til I'm numb, rise above with me
No, I won't sleep tonight

[Verse 2]
They whine and roar, hungry for more
Yellow glowing eyes, I'm hypnotized
I feel brave yet scared, I will stay prepared
Oh have my soul, it's destined
It's written in the sky
Let me not be blinded by this hurt
Set him loose I'm ready
For the stars to guide me

[Chorus]
No, I won't sleep tonight
If tomorrow comes I'll loose my mind

No, I won't sleep tonight
If tomorrow comes, I'll loose my mind
I won't give up my right
I know every heart deserves a fight
I will beat on the drum, rise above with me
I will go 'til I'm numb, rise above with me
No, I won't sleep tonight

[Outro]
No, I won't sleep tonight
If tomorrow comes I'll loose my mind"
Unbroken,"One step at a time
Out of the darkness
One foot in front of the other

One step at a time
Into the distance
A new path I need to uncover

I‘m letting go
Go

One step at a time
Get out of the darkness
And into the light forever
One step at a time
I pick up the pieces
Try putting them back together
Till I‘m unbroken
Unbroken
One step at a time
Get out of the darkness
And into the light forever

One step at a time
And I got a feeling
It‘s either now or never

I‘m letting go
Go

One step at a time
Get out of the darkness
And into the light forever
One step at a time
I pick up the pieces
Try putting them back together
Till I‘m unbroken
Unbroken

One step at a time
Get out of the darkness
And into the light forever

I‘m letting go
Go

One step at a time
Get out of the darkness
And into the light forever
One step at a time
I pick up the pieces
Try putting them back together
Till I‘m unbroken
Unbroken

One step at a time
Get out of the darkness
And into the light forever

I‘m letting go
Go

One step at a time
Get out of the darkness
And into the light forever
One step at a time
I pick up the pieces
Try putting them back together
’til I‘m unbroken
Unbroken

One step at a time
Get out of the darkness
And into the light forever"
Heroes,"[Verse 1]
Don't tell the gods I left a mess
I can't undo what has been done
Let's run for cover
What if I'm the only hero left
You better fire off your gun, once and forever
He said go dry your eyes and live your life like there is no tomorrow, son
And tell the others to go sing it like a hummingbird
The greatest anthem ever heard

[Chorus 1]
We are the heroes of our time
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
We are the heroes of our time
Hero-oh-o-o-oes. o-uh-o-o-oh
We're dancing with the demons in our minds
Hero-uh-o-o-o
O-oh-o-o-oh
We are the heroes of our time
Hero-oh-o-o-oes, o-uh-o-o-oh
We're dancing with the demons in our minds
Hero-oh-o-o-oes, o-uh-o-o-oh

[Verse 2]
The crickets sing a song for you
Don't say a word, don't make a sound
It's life's creation
I make worms turn into butterflies
Wake up and turn this world around in appreciation
He said I never left your side
When you were lost I followed right behind
Was your foundation
Now go sing it like a hummingbird
The greatest anthem ever heard

[Chorus 1]
We are the heroes of our time
Hero-uh-o-o-oes, o-uh-o-o-oh
We're dancing with the demons in our minds
Hero-oh-o-o-oes, o-uh-o-o-oh
(We keep dancing with the demons)
(You could be a hero)

[Bridge]
Now go sing it like a hummingbird
The greatest anthem ever heard
Now sing together

[Chorus 2]
We are the heroes of our time
(Hero-oh-o-o-oes. o-uh-o-o-oh)
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
(Hero-oh-o-o-oes. o-uh-o-o-oh)
We are the heroes of our time
(We keep dancing with the demons)
(You could be a hero)
Hero-oh-o-o-oes. o-uh-o-o-oh
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
(We keep dancing with the demons)
(You could be a hero)
Hero-oh-o-o-oes. o-uh-o-o-oh

We are the heroes"
Time to Shine,"[Refrain]
I’ve been walking in the darkness
Always hiding from my true self
Afraid of letting go, of deception in their eyes
A wounded ego, unafraid to start a fight

I’ve been walking on a lonely road
So many stories I have once been told
No matter what they say I will follow my heart
I think it’s time for me to stand up and hold my ground

[Refrain]
I’ve been walking in the darkness
Always hiding from my true self
Afraid of letting go, of deception in their eyes
A wounded ego, unafraid to start a fight

‘Cause I’m living my dreams, I’ve never been so alive
The sky’s the limit now that I know I can fly
No more pulling me down, no more mucking around
I’m growing up, and it’s my time to shine
It doesn’t matter if I’m wrong or right
I’m getting stronger everytime I try
I’ve learnt to let it go, taking one step at a time
I’ve mend my ego, now it’s time for me to let it shine

[Refrain]
I’ve been walking in the darkness
Always hiding from my true self
Afraid of letting go, of deception in their eyes
A wounded ego, unafraid to start a fight

It's my time to shine
I’ve been walking in the darkness
Always hiding from my true self
I’ve learnt to let it go, I’ve learnt to let it go, I’ve learnt to let it go
Now it’s my time to shine

[Refrain]
I’ve been walking in the darkness
Always hiding from my true self
Afraid of letting go, of deception in their eyes
A wounded ego, unafraid to start a fight

‘Cause I’m living my dreams, I’ve never been so alive
The sky’s the limit now that I know I can fly
No more pulling me down, no more mucking around
I’m growing up, and it’s my time to shine
It’s my time to shine, it’s my time to shine"
One Thing I Should Have Done,"Tonight the rain is falling
I’m feeling cold, and I’m
Out of my mind, without you
My head is spinning like a top
Back to the time we had a lot…going on
Now my world lies shattered
How quickly life can change

I always did everything for you
I gave you my heart, you gave me yours too
You’d make me feel I was really someone
But there’s one thing I should have done

One day you think you have it all
The next you’re staring at the wall…in a dream
The road that once was paved with gold
Has turned a rusty shade
Of all the saddest colours in the world
Now my life’s in tatters
How quickly it all can change

I always did everything for you
I gave you my heart, you gave me yours too
You’d make me feel I was really someone
But there’s one thing I should have done

I should have been there for you
I should have been there for you
I should have been there for you
I should have been there

I didn’t do everything for you
But I tried so hard and that’s the truth
I’d make you feel you were really someone
But there’s one thing I should have done

I nearly did everything for you
But I broke your heart, now mine’s broken too
In your hour of need, I didn’t come…..
That’s the one thing I should……..have done"
Here for You,"When you're down, down, low
And there's no place you can go...
When you're down, down, low
You know that I am here for you...

You came into my life when I was broken
You heated up my heart when it was frozen
And we got the flow
Now it's up we go (we go, we go, we go, we go)

And now that it's your turn you wanna hide it
A million times already you've denied it
You don't have to fear
You don't have to fight (fight, fight, fight, fight, fight)

When you're down, down, low
Sinking in the undertow
When you're down, down, low
You know that I am here for you (for you)

Cause I know, know baby
All the hurt you never show
When you're down, down, low
You gotta let me heal your aching soul

You came into my life when I was broken
You heated up my heart when it was frozen
And we got the flow
Now it's up we go (we go, we go, we go, we go)

Cause you released my pain, now let me take it
Just leave it at the door and we can make it
You don't have to hide
I am by your side (side, side)

Everybody else sees in black and white
You look at wrong and make it right
Can't I open, your eyes (your eyes, your eyes, your eyes)

When you are down, down, low
Seeking in the undertow
When you are down, down, low
You know that I am here for you (for you)

Cause I know, know baby
All the hurt you never show
When you are down, down, low
You gotta let me heal your aching soul

When you are down, down, low
Seeking in the undertow
When you are down, down, low
You know that I am here for you (for you)

Cause I know, know baby
All the hurt you never show
When you're down, down, low
You gotta let me heal your aching soul

When you are down, down, low
Seeking in the undertow
When you are down, down, low
You know that I am here for you"
In the Name of Love,"Every time you’re brokenhearted
Sinking in the sorrow
Feel the emptiness and have no faith
No strength to breathe

I wanna tell you
It’s gonna be better
You've got the greatness within you

Beyond the fear
Let’s build the bridge
From heart to heart
In the name of love

Every time you struggle with the fear about tomorrow
Call the angels for their guidance
Find the other way

I wanna tell you
It’s gonna be better
You've got the greatness within you

Beyond the fear
Let’s build the bridge
From heart to heart
In the name of love

Beyond the fear
Let’s build the bridge
From heart to heart
In the name of love (x4)"
N'oubliez pas,"Tears are everythig, that is left for me
These few notes from the past
And the melody of our prayers
Our hearts, that are hoping
And the emptiness beneath my steps Ashes are everything, that is left for me
Of my village plunged into silence
I am only a wound
A heart without armour
How to survive after this? But I am there, I don't forget
In my village swept away by history
And I live there, don't forget
Erased from the maps and memories I remember the laughter of children
The voices of the men leaving for the field
The harvest celebrations
The smell inside the houses
The bursts of love and joy But I am there, don't forget
Erased from the maps and memories When they arrived
Hidden behind their weapons
They were thousands
They laughed at our tears They wanted to destroy
Our beliefs and our souls
With words of hatred
That we didn't know I am here tonight
In the middle of these ruins
To talk to you about hope
And to sing about life
And I make the promise
That when the blood will dry
I will rebuild my city
Even more beautiful than before But don't forget"
Still in Love with You,"[Verse 1a, Alex Larke]
Well, don’t get on the wrong train
Don’t fly in an old plane

You might get wet I’d be upset
You’re bound to get sneezes
Or nasty diseases
Take good care when I’m not there
I’m still in love with you

[Verse 1b, Bianca Nicholas]
While I’m on vacation
You be a good patient
Take your medication
I worry so each time I go
Try to keep warm, dear
In case there’s a storm, dear
Take good care while I’m not there
I’m still in love with you

[Verse 2a, Alex Larke]
Some younger guys with roving eyes
May tantalise you with their lies
You must be wise and realise
Leave well alone till you get home, dear

Don’t wanna make you jealous
No need to fear when you’re not here
I’m still in love with you

Because you’re so gorgeous
You need to be cautious
Take good care when I’m not there, I’m still in love with you
You have a fun time
And soak up that sunshine
But don’t drink too much wine
Just one or two will have to do

[Verse 5b, Bianca Nicholas]
I know what you’re thinking
So I won’t be drinking
No need to fear when you’re not here, I’m still in love with you

I Am Yours,"[Verse 1]
Anytime that you’re thinking of me
That you might want me
I’ll come on over
Don’t you know
Anytime, any place, I am yours
You’re a lesson that I love learning
So any time that you’ve got a yearning
Don’t you know
Anytime, any place, I am yours

You’re what I belong to
The one thing that feels true
Everything I could ever want
If you ever need me
I’m waiting on you
To walk right through that door
Anytime, any place, I am yours

If you're hoping for second chances of
Stolen kisses I got the answer
Don’t you know

Black Smoke,"[Verse 1]
When you look at me
You know you’re hard to read
Because the face I see is not the one I know
And when you call me “Baby”
What’s that supposed to mean?
I don’t know who you are, how long can we pretend?

[Pre-Chorus]
See the change I know
We both don’t have the heart to say
Can’t return to what we burn
We’ll never be the same

[Chorus]
‘Cause you said you’d never let me go
And I said I can but now we know
That it’s too hard to say three words
Too hard to make it work
When there’s nothing left to talk about
‘Cause you know the flame is running out
Two hearts are left to burn, do you know
We’re only left with smoke

[Hook]
Black smoke
We’re only left with smoke
Black smoke

[Verse 2]
I try to tell myself
That it’s all in my head
But the truth remains, we’re just too far apart
You know we’re fooling ourselves if we hold on
‘Cause we’re fighting for something that we don’t want
Just leave it now and walk away

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

(Too hard to say three words) Black smoke
(Too hard to make it work) We’re only left with smoke
(Too hard to say three words) Black smoke
(Too hard to make it work)

‘Cause you said you’d never let me go, oh no
Yeah, you said you’d never let me go

Amanecer,"He left not knowing
that I did love him.
He left not believing in me. I lost my mind.
I bled so much love
that even today I feel the void
takes me to you. My heart whispered to me
don't return without his love. I walk on yesterday's path.
Wherever you are.
Today I challenge oblivion. He left not knowing
that I don't give up. My heart whispered to me
don't return without his love. Return to me the soul that's still standing.
Return to me the dawn.
Today you'll return to me. My heart whispered to me
don't return without his love. Return to me the soul that's still standing.
Return to me the dawn."
Grande amore,"I close my eyes and think of her
The sweet scent of her skin
It 'a voice inside that is taking me where the sun rises Alone, are the words
But if they should be written everything can change
No more fear I'll want to shout this great love
Love, only love is what I feel Tell me why when I think, I just think of you
Tell me why when I see, I see only you
Tell me why when I believe, I believe in you only great love
Tell me you never
That will never leave me
Tell me who you are
Breath of my days of love
Tell me what you know
That only me choose
Now you know
You are my only, great love Pass springs,
Cold days and stupid to remember
Cursed nights, lost no sleep other to make love

Forever, for me. Tell me why when I think, I just think of you
Tell me why when I love, love only you
Tell me why I live, I live only in you great love

And darkness has taken your sight
There’s no need to be carrying a frown

When you feel like your dreams are beaten down
And your fire is losing its light
There’s no need to be carrying a frown
I’ll help you sing it out tonight

Don’t you worry about it, don’t you worry about it
You just gotta sing it away

Sing it away, never make me fade away
Sing it away, all my troubles away
Sing it away, huh huh huh

The dream we had disappeared
Still I believe, I’m holding on
I didn’t mean to let you down

Flashing lights, I close my eyes
I let the sunlight comfort me
When all that’s left are memories

We could be the brightest falling stars

The wildest fire
Is burning out, out

And when our fall torn us to pieces
All of our love turned into dust
We’re the brightest falling stars

The thought of us all disappeared
Still I believe, I’m holding on

And when our fall torn us to pieces
All of our love turned into dust
We’re the brightest falling stars"

Your enemy might be your own mind
A smile, a hug, a bit of praise
You haven’t received for days
For lo-o-ong you feel mistreated
In a world where the poems sound fake
And the love is replaced by the fame

[Refren: Freddie]
Million hearts of a million people
Be proud, you were born to be real oh-oh
Million lies in a million temples
It’s only fear, become a pioneer oh-oh

[Verse 2: Freddie]
You’ve been weird, been a mess
They don’t know how to value uniqueness
So they turn their heads away
When there ain’t no products to sell
Everyone will cast their own spell

[Refren: Freddie]
Million hearts of a million people
Be proud, you were born to be real oh-oh
Million lies in a million temples
It’s only fear, become a pioneer oh-oh

[Verse 3: Freddie]
No right time, no right place
To meet your inner grace
Approval is found within

[Refren: Freddie]
Million hearts of a million people
Be proud, you were born to be real oh-oh
Million lies in a million temples
It’s only fear, become a pioneer oh-oh
You should know, you should know"
Lighthouse,"[Verse 1]
Lightning strikes on the sea
Breaking waves around me
Stormy tides
And I feel my ship capsizing
Out of sight, saving shore
Ever gone, evermore
Ropes untied
Rain that pours, the water’s rising

[Pre-Chorus 1]
In devastating times, I keep this hope of mine
Even in the darkest night

[Chorus]
‘Cause there is a light guiding my way
Keeping me safe when oceans rage
There in the sky, hiding away
Never to die and fade
I know that I’ll find your lighthouse, your lighthouse
I know that I’ll find your

[Verse 2]
Harbour’s near, no more fear
Wall of clouds disappears
So I steer to the pier
In tears, arriving

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No devastating times, I kept this hope of mine
Even in the darkest night

[Chorus]
‘Cause there is a light guiding my way
Keeping me safe when oceans rage
There in the sky, hiding away
Never to die and fade
I know that I’ll find your (your lighthouse, your lighthouse, your lighthouse)
I know that I’ll find your (your lighthouse, your lighthouse, your lighthouse)

There is a light
Keeping me safe when oceans rage
There in the sky, hiding away
Never to die and fade
I know that I’ll find your, your lighthouse
Your lighthouse, your lighthouse
Your lighthouse, your lighthouse"
Slow Down,"[Verse 1]
I’m going nowhere and I’m going fast
I should find a place to go and rest
I should find a place to lay my head tonight

[Verse 2]
Every morning there’s another start
Every morning hits so hard
Guess I’m running scared, guess I’m running on empty

[Pre-Chorus]
Mister, can you help me?
‘Cause it seems I’ve been lead astray
I keep searching for an answer, for a way
Won’t you help me?

[Chorus]
You gotta slow down, brother
Slow down, brother
Slow down if you can’t go on
Slow down, brother
Slow down, brother
Slow down if you can’t go on

[Verse 3]
Do you think I’ll ever learn
I used to be without concern
Now all I ever do don’t seem to free me

[Pre-Chorus]
Mister, can you help me?
‘Cause it seems I’ve been lead astray
I keep searching for an answer today
Won’t you help me?

[Chorus]
You gotta slow down, brother
Slow down, brother
Slow down if you can’t go on
Slow down, brother
Slow down, brother
Slow down if you can’t go on

Slow down, brother
Slow down, brother
Slow down if you can’t go on

Slow down if you can’t go on

Slow down, brother
Slow down if you can’t go on"
LoveWave,"[Intro - spoken]
Hey it’s me
Look, I know it might sound strange but suddenly I’m not the same I used to be
It’s like I’ve stepped out of space and time and come alive… Guess this is what it’s all about cause…

[Verse 1]
...when it touched me the world went silent
Calm before the storm reaches me
The ground in motion set off all sirens
You took over my heartbeat... beat... beat... beat...
It’s taking over me

[Chorus]
You
Shook my life like an earthquake now I’m waking up
You
Gave me faith now I can break every single wall
You
Prove we can do it all when all is out of love
You (oh like a lovewave)
Spread a lovewave ´n my heart goes ba-ba-da-bu-who-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Caught in a downward spiral
I lost my soul in my dreams
I would give up and lose all trials
When one moment changed everything

Without even a single warning
I’m not who I was before
A chain reaction with no returning
Now watch me craving for more

It’s taking over me

[Instrumental]

It’s taking, it’s taking over me

[Chorus]
You(oh like a lovewave)
Shook my life like an earthquake now I’m waking up
You
Like a loveware
Gave me faith now I can break every single wall
You
Prove we can do it all when all is out of love
Spread a lovewave ´n my heart goes ba-ba-da-bu-who-oh-oh"
I Didn't Know,"[Verse 1]
I want to stay with you tonight
Far from every sight and every fear
I got to be inside your mind
And hide into your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you more and more each day
I’ve got to say I’m addicted
We’ll sail together through the skies
Your eyes never told me lies

[Chorus]
I didn’t know that I’m falling for you
And my dreams could come true
I didn’t know that you’re warm like the sun
Our life has just begun

I didn’t know you’re the one for me
I thought I’d never find
I didn’t know that you wished for the moon
To provide me the light

[Interlude]
(Oh.. oh… oh…)

You Are the Only One,"[Verse 1]
We can never let the word be unspoken
We will never let our loving go, come undone
Everything we had is staying unbroken, oh
You will always be the only one
You're the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
Won't ever give up cause you're still somewhere out there
Nothing or no one's gonna keep us apart
Breaking it down but I'm still getting nowhere
Won't stop, hold on

[Chorus]
Thunder and lightning, it's getting exciting
Lights up the skyline to show where you are
My love is rising, the story's unwinding
Together we'll make it and reach for the stars

You're the only one, you're my only one
You're my life, every breath that I take
Unforgettable, so unbelievable
You're the only one, my only one

[Verse 2]
I could have told you to slow down and stay down
I could have told you a secret, won't you keep it now?
Thinking of making a showdown when love is found
Thinking of waiting till you're around

[Pre-Chorus]
Won't ever give up cause you're still somewhere out there
Nothing or no one's gonna keep us apart
Breaking it down but I'm still getting nowhere
Won't stop, hold on

Lights up the skyline to show where you are
My love is rising, the story's unwinding
Together we'll make it and reach for the stars

Lights up the skyline to show where you are
To show where you are…

You're my life, every breath that I take
Unforgettable, so unbelievable
You're the only one, my only one"
I Stand,"[Verse 1]
I’ve worn the path
I’ve hit the wall
I’m the one who rose and fall
I’ve played my heart
When I played the part
But it got me through the rain
I have felt the strain
I’ve made mistakes
With the monsters in my head
But in the end
You’re standing there
You’re the one who always cares

[Chorus]
Cause I stand
I stand
I am standing here
Just because of you
Every part of me is a part of you
I stand

[Verse 2]
I’m standing tall
I can hold it all
Now I see where I belong
The choice I made
Helped me understand
Now this life is mine to play
I am thanking you, you made me
You are my air
I’ll always care

[Chorus]
I stand...

You never lose hold of me
You always trust and you see
I stand
I stand"
Alter Ego,"Waking up alone like a man that failed
Trapped into the mist of a fairytale
And you know, you know, you know
I’m still inside

I knew it all along but I couldn’t tell
This kind of love would lock my heart in jail
And you know, you know, you know
It’s doing time

I’m caught in the middle of the dawn and the sunrise
Life is a miracle, I saw it in your eyes
Under a spotlight, I howl in the moonlight
Howling for you

Take it on, take it on and get me through the night
Take it on, take it on until the morning light
Take it on, take it on and get me through the night
Take it on, take it on, take it on

I heard it all before, people always say
Time can take the sorrow and the pain away
And you know, you know
This love will never die

I’m caught in the middle of the dawn and the sunrise
Life is a miracle, I saw it in your eyes
Under a spotlight, I howl in the moonlight
Howling for you

I’m caught in the middle of the dawn and the sunrise
Life is a miracle, I saw it in your eyes
Under a spotlight, I howl in the moonlight
Howling for you

Take it on, take it on and get me through the night
Take it on, take it on until the morning light
Take it on, take it on and get me through the night
Take it on, take it on, take it on

I cross the oceans, fly on the skyline
Drive any road that will bring me by your side

Take it on, take it on and get me through the night
Take it on, take it on until the morning light
Take it on, take it on and get me through the night
Take it on, take it on, take it on

Caught in the middle of the dawn and the sunrise
Life is a miracle, I saw it in your eyes"

Play,"[Verse 1]
It's getting late and be that as it may
I turn to you, I turn to you
We might seem so obvious to me
But not to you, not to you

[Pre-Chrous]
We ain't got all night
To find out what is right
So let's go undecided 'till we know
The only way to go
Is let your feelings show
See all your walls come down
And just hit

But the radio stopped to play us long ago, long ago

Hear Them Calling,"[Verse 1:]
Can you hear them calling?
Oh, they’re calling out tonight
Now the skies are burning
Oh, they burn so bright
We shiver as we step into the cold, cold night
Then we’re running, we are running now

Singing: “Now we are coming home”

Ljubav je,"I’ll need your body
When I close my eyes
Everything’s white around me
Even the gray walls I’ve got no one to come back to
I only trust you
I’ll pay all my dues
I swear by love Love is an enchanted circle
Everyone gets their own turn
Everyone pays their due
Love is all we’ve got
Everyone chooses their own sin
We forgive each other ... we forgive I need your body so much
When I close my eyes
The heart swore by you
How can I forgive you? I’ve got no one to come back to
I only trust you
I’ll pay all my dues
I swear by love Instead of being a captain, I chose to be a pirate
Instead of being happy, I chose to be sad in spite
My story’s a roulette — I invest, but don’t know how to cash out
Cursed by her eyes, I don’t know how to smile anymore
And she lures me with her curves after a glass or two of wine
But she ain’t the one who’s gonna give me a son tomorrow
Then again, no other woman knows how to touch me in such a magical way
I’m tragically drunk, yet again ‘cause the devil won't leave me alone! Love is an enchanted circle
Everyone gets their own turn
Everyone pays their due
Love is all we’ve got
Everyone chooses their own sin
We forgive each other
We forgive"

I've been fading into grey
Trying to be someone
Trying to please someone

I've been painting bitter blue
Always hitting walls
Always trying to break the fall

I'm not perfect, but I'm A-ok
Chasing off the clouds

Feeling your heartbeat
That’s what I want
That’s what I need
Feeling again, that you’re breathing with me

But all the battles are in vain
You mean more than anything to me

Color of Your Life,"[Verse 1]
When loneliness is knocking on your door
Everything you loved just disappears
And when you feel that everything is lost
You need to know there's no life without tears

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh
Tell me, black or white
What color is your life?
Oh oh oh oh
Try to ask your heart
Who you really are

No one is forever beautiful and young
Everything you know just disappears
Fame and gold are nothing, you can be sure
When there is no love in your heart
The choice is yours, who you really want to be
Don't be afraid of your destiny
So when you feel that everything is lost
You need to know there's no life without fear

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh
Tell me, black or white
What color is your life?
Oh oh oh oh
Try to ask your heart
Who you really are

[Bridge]
Every day we must fight with that wind
We have to live
All these things are just empty desire
Cause there's no smoke without fire

Oh oh oh oh
Tell me, black or white
What color is your life?
Oh oh oh oh
Try to ask your heart
Who you really are
Oh oh oh oh
Try to ask your heart
What color is your life?"
The Last of Our Kind,"Soldier, take off your armour
Show me your heart, this is home

And it’s stronger, stronger than water
Deeper than reason, longer than time

Here we are at the end of the movie
I’ve never felt more alive
It’s time to rise

We’re the last of our kind
It’s a whole new world
And we’re facing the fire
Not afraid of our own ghosts
We’re the last of our kind
And we’re all that we know
And we’re out of our minds
Not afraid to be brave though

We’re the last of our kind
The last of our kind
The last of our kind
Not afraid to be brave
We’re the last of our kind

This is paradise
Turn off the search light
Where we belong

Standing tall at the end of the story
Watching worlds collide
It’s time to rise

We’re the last of our kind
It’s a whole new world
And we’re facing the fire
Not afraid of our own ghosts
We’re the last of our kind
And we’re all that we know
And we’re out of our minds
Not afraid to be brave though

We’re the last of our kind
Here we are now, with nothing to lose
I know without love, we won’t pull through
Cause deep in the night, there is a light and it guides us to truth

It’s a whole new world
And we’re facing the fire
Not afraid of our own ghosts

We’re the last of our kind
And we’re all that we know
And we’re out of our minds
Not afraid to be brave though

We’re the last of our kind
The last of our kind
The last of our kind
Not afraid to be brave
We’re the last of our kind"

Help You Fly,"I will help you learn how to fly, how to fly

Do you remember when you were younger
You didn't worry for a day
Now all the questions and no direction
They make our reasons insane

It's time you released yourself
Before you can let go

I will help you learn how to fly, how to fly
Free, leave all the madness behind, far behind

You feel like you ate the poison
It's time to heal you from the pain
I know that you've been the hunted
I want to free you again

It's time you released yourself
Before you can let go

I will help you learn how to fly, how to fly
Free, leave all the madness behind, far behind

If I can fly then you can
If I can fly then you can fly
If I can fly then you can fly
If I can fly (If I can fly)
If I can fly

I will help you learn how to fly, how to fly
Free, leave all the madness behind, far behind
All behind"
Goodbye (Shelter),"[Verse 1]
I wish I could stop it, wish I could fight it
But there's nothing I can do
I thought that we were meant for each other
Oh, how I wish I knew you better

[Pre-Chorus]
I played a fool so many times
Can't event count it

[Chorus]
Everytime I say goodbye
You try to hold me by your side
Couldn't fight my way out of your hands
Find a shelter from the pain
Everytime you say your lies
I hide away and close my eyes
I won't let you tear my world apart
Gonna find a shelter for my heart

[Verse 2]
I thought that it was supposed to hurt me
I thought that it was love
I put my hands up but I won't surrender
Don't need what doesn't serve me anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
I lick my wounds
So that I can keep on fighting

[Chorus]
Everytime I say goodbye
You try to hold me by your side
Couldn't fight my way out of your hands
Find a shelter from the pain
Everytime you say your lies
I hide away and close my eyes
I won't let you tear my world apart
Gonna find a shelter for my heart

[Bridge]
Everytime I say goodbye
Baby, stay away this time

[Outro]
Everytime I say goodbye
I will fight my way out of your hands
Everytime
Won't let you tear my world apart
Gonna find a shelter for my heart"
Sunlight,"[Verse 1]
Don't be afraid
It's only dark
Till the world
Turns round
Just don't look down
If you're afraid of
The higher ground
Hold on to me and let
Me hold on to you
We don't look back
We let it slide out of view
And we can make it if we
Break out beyond these clouds

[Chorus]
We'll be standing out in the
Sunlight
We stay together
We'll live forever in the
Sunlight
It's now or never
You know you better
Just touch who you wanna
Kiss who you gotta
Fight like we're winners
Love like beginners
Dance like you mean it
Sing like you feel it
Everything's better
Standing out in the sun

[Verse 2]
Stop for a moment just
To take in the
Sights and sounds
Hold on to me and let
Me hold onto you
We don't look back
We let it slide out of view
There's no tomorrow
So let's live in the here and now

[Chorus]
We'll be standing out in the
Sunlight
We stay together
We'll live forever in the
Sunlight
It's now or never
You know you better
Just touch who you wanna
Kiss who you gotta
Fight like we're winners
Love like beginners
Dance like you mean it
Sing like you feel it
Everything's better
Standing out in the sun

[Bridge]
Come turn me
Inside out upside down
I'll be your lover boy
Turn the music loud
We can join the crowd

[Chorus]
In the sunlight
We stay together
We'll live forever in the
Sunlight
It's now or never
You know you better
Just touch who you wanna
Kiss who you gotta
Fight like we're winners
Love like beginners
Dance like you mean it
Sing like you feel it
Everything's better
Standing out in the sun

In the sunlight
We stay together
We'll live forever in the
Sunlight
It's now or never
You know you better
Just touch who you wanna
Kiss who you gotta
Fight like we're winners
Love like beginners
Dance like you mean it
Sing like you feel it
Everything's better
Standing out in the sun"
Dona (Дона),"Look into my eyes now,
I'm not a looser, know it!
I don't surrender till the end
there's no raising without falling. Open your soul and confess to me
Now, truly what are we
Half of me - inside of you
and half of you - sleeps inside me
Come on hug me now, and raise me to the sky Everything's black and white
One truth, and one lie
Even though together we are
cheerfulness I choose - you choose the sorrow. Everything's black and white
Goodness and badness can't be apart
Come on, give me a smile
The day leads me to shinny nights Look into my eyes now,
There everything you will find
Come on, surrender altogether
for new beginning - with me. Open your soul and confess to me
Now, what we truly are
Half of me - inside of you
and half of you - sleeps inside me
Come on hug me now, and raise me to the sky Everything's black and white
One truth and one lie
Even though together we are
cheerfulness I choose - you choose the sorrow. Everything's black and white
Goodness and badness can't be apart
Come on, give me a smile
The day leads me to shinny nights Everything's black and white
One truth and one lie
Even though together we are
cheerfulness I choose - you choose the sorrow. Everything's black and white
Goodness and badness can't be apart
Come on, give me a smile
The day leads me to shinny nights Everything's black and white"
I've Been Waiting for This Night,"[Verse 1]
Here we are together you and I, I
Watching lights around us fill the night, night
I was living in the dark
Tried to heal my broken heart
Until now
Here we are together you and I, I

[Chorus]
For a thousand years through a million tears
With a hungry heart, every day apart
I've been waiting for this night
I've been waiting for this night
When I see your smile and your beautiful eyes
I get lost in time, now I know that I
I've been waiting for this night
I've been waiting for this night

[Verse 2]
If only I could stay here by your side, side
To promise you forever here tonight, night
There is nothing I can do
That can take my heart from you
Always yours
If only I could stay here by your side, side

For a thousand years through a million tears
With a hungry heart, every day apart
I've been waiting for this night
I've been waiting for this night
When I see your smile and your beautiful eyes
I get lost in time, now I know that I
I've been waiting for this night
I've been waiting for this night

I get lost in time, now I know that I
I've been waiting for this night
I've been waiting for this night

Sound of Silence,"[Verse 1]
Growing tired and weary, brown eyes
Tryna feel your love through Facetime
Symphonies of dreams and highlights
Caught up in this crazy fast life
But baby you're not here with me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I keep calling, calling
Keep calling cause

[Chorus]
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
Getting hard to break through the madness
You're not here, it never makes sense
Tidal waves of tears are crashin'
No one here to save me drownin'
Cause baby you're not here with me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I keep calling, calling
Keep calling cause

[Chorus]
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence

[Bridge]
I know I'm stronger and I'm capable
I know it's all in my head
But I keep calling, calling
Calling, calling

[Chorus]
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
Silence, silence"
Blue and Red,"[Intro]
Allay

[Verse 1]
Blue and red
Like I’m watching you and me
Every little thing you said
Led me to fall in love with you

Then you tried to fix me and I wasn’t strong
But you are not a composer, I am not your song
Strange chords, different words

[Pre-Chorus]
How can I mix red and blue together?
Beautiful days and stormy weather

Allay, allay, allay

[Chorus]
‘Cause blue is blue and red is red
Our past is spinning in my head
But now the colour doesn’t matter
You feel blue and and I am better

[Verse 2]
Now I’m changed
Now I’m stronger than before
Ain’t never touching me no more
I’m okay, I’ll find my way

[Pre-Chorus]
How can I mix red and blue together?
Beautiful days and stormy weather

Allay, allay, allay

[Chorus]
‘Cause blue is blue and red is red
Our past is spinning in my head
But now the colour doesn’t matter
You feel blue and and I am better

If Love Was a Crime,"[Verse 1]
You and I we collide
Like the stars on the summer night
We can shine forever
And you and I, we're alive
What we feel is what is right
We can run like never

[Pre-Chorus]
If love was a crime then we would be criminals
Locked up for life but I'll do the time
If love was a crime then we would work miracles
High above the ground

They will never break us down!
О, дай ми любовта
Дай ми любовта
О, дай ми любовта
They will never break us down
О, дай ми любовта
Дай ми любовта

Never mind
Wrong or right
Our love ain't got no pride
So we change for better

Unafraid
Never fade
When it's dark, we illuminate
Can we rise together?

[Pre-Chorus]
If love was a crime then we would be criminals
Locked up for life and I'll do the time
If love was a crime then we would work miracles
High above the ground

Soldiers of Love,"[Verse 1]
Tell me why we always fuel the fire
Why we tend to close our eyes
What’s the reason that we keep on hiding?
We can make it if we try

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t know why we don’t care
There’s nothing to fear when I know you are there
So let’s not wait for someone else
To make it right, make it right

[Chorus]
Take my hand and never let go
Side by side we walk an open road
Unbreakable with hope in our hearts
Step by step we’ll make a new start

Let’s be soldiers of love, soldiers of love
Soldiers of love for life
Take my hand and never let go
Never let go and let’s be soldiers of love

[Verse 2]
What’s the meaning of a world on fire
And a heart without a soul?
I believe that we can shine a light on
What we already ought to know

[Pre-Chorus]
So let’s not wait for someone else
To make it right, make it right

[Chorus]
Take my hand and never let go
Side by side we walk an open road
Unbreakable with hope in our hearts
Step by step we’ll make a new start

Let’s be soldiers of love, soldiers of love
Soldiers of love for life
Take my hand and never let go
Never let go and let’s be soldiers of love

Unbreakable, don’t let it go
It’s an open road, time to let it show
Invincible, gonna climb the wall

Take my hand and never let go
Never let go

Take my hand and never let go
Side by side we walk an open road
Unbreakable with hope in our hearts
Step by step we’ll make a new start (Make a new start)

Let’s be soldiers of love, soldiers of love
Soldiers of love for life
Take my hand and never let go
Never let go and let’s be soldiers of love"
1944,"[Verse 1]
When strangers are coming
They come to your house
They kill you all
And say
We’re not guilty
Not guilty

Where is your mind?
Humanity cries
You think you are gods
But everyone dies
Don't swallow my soul
Our souls

[Chorus]
Yaşlığıma toyalmadım
Men bu yerde yaşalmadım
Yaşlığıma toyalmadım
Men bu yerde yaşalmadım

We could build a future

The happiest time
Hard time

Icebreaker,"Every night
Before I sleep, a shiver down my spine
Thoughts align
What can I do to make you listen?

Like a northern light
You're dancing over every borderline
Passing every sign
Between reality and fiction

Every single promise that you ever made
Spinning in my mind like a hurricane
Baby, yes I hear your mayday
Mayday

I'll be your icebreaker
When you're stuck in frozen water, frozen water
Icebreaker
When you're stuck in frozen water, frozen water

You go astray
Just like a polaroid you fade away
I'll be your partner
And liberate you from your prison

Baby, yes I hear your mayday
Mayday

I'll be your icebreaker
When you're stuck in frozen water, frozen water
Icebreaker
When you're stuck in frozen water, frozen water

We're way too young to say goodbye
Whenever you lose faith just hold the line
It takes a lot of nerve to save a life…

Icebreaker
When you're stuck in frozen water, frozen water
Icebreaker
When you're stuck in frozen water
Frozen water"
Midnight Gold,"[Verse 1]
When I came to
Your smell on me
I reached around the bed
And grabbed a cigarette out of your bag

Sound of you breathing
Feel of your skin
Brought back some memories
I never thought this all could happen to me

[Verse 2]
Ten hours are missing
From memory
I vaguely can recall
Pain and pleasure mixing in one bowl

My mind is spinning
I know the bliss
One million miles away
My flesh and bones are dreaming in a haze

[Chorus]
Stains of mud on your skin
Night will come and so will sin
Stains of mud on your skin
Night will come and so will sin

Stains of mud on your skin
Night will come and so will sin
Stains of mud on your skin
On your skin, on your skin, so come on

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
When I came to
Your smell on me
I reached around the bed
And grabbed a cigarette out of your bag"
Fairytale,"[Verse 1]
This tale of love
Larger than dreams
It may take a lifetime
To understand what it means
So many tears
All the craziness and rage
Tale of love, love
The message is love can bring change

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause it's you, only you
You I feel
And I, oh I
I know in my soul this is real

[Chorus]
And that's why I love you, oh oh
Yes I love you, oh oh
And I'd fight for you, give my life for you
My heart

[Verse 2]
But comes a day when it's not enough
What you have, and the time is up
But it's hard to turn a new page
In this tale, sweet tale of love
You will find peace in your heart
That you crave

[Bridge]
Oh oh oh oh ohoh oh
Ohoh oh ohoh
Oh oh oh oh ohoh oh
Ohoh oh ohoh
Oh oh oh oh ohoh oh

Yes I love you, oh oh

What's the Pressure,"[Verse 1]
Don’t ask me why the sun is shining
Long after the day is done
The evening falls, the bright lights
Bring out the best in me

[Pre-Chorus]
I see massive walls weighing down people all around
But they don’t seem to mind at all
I will try to stand my ground, won’t be bound
And bring out the best in me

[Chorus]
What’s the pressure?
You will grow, you will know in the end
That this is fiction
It’s in your mind, live your life instead

[Verse 2]
Don’t ask me why the sun is shining
It brings me all the joy and hope and light
Even though these rules they, try'na take over me
Try'na take over me, I see

[Pre-Chorus]
I see massive falls weighing down people all around
But they don’t seem to mind at all
I will try to stand my ground, won’t be bound
And bring out the best in me

[Chorus]
What’s the pressure?
You will grow, you will know in the end
That this is fiction
It’s in your mind, live your life instead
Now what’s the pressure?
This is fiction
It’s in your mind, live your life the best

[Bridge]
You gotta do what you wanna do
You gotta be who you wanna be
So tell me, what’s the pressure?

[Chorus]
What’s the pressure?
And this is fiction
It’s in your mind, live your life instead
Now what’s the pressure?
You will grow and you will know in the end
That this is fiction
It’s in your mind, live your life the best"
No Degree of Separation (Nessun grado di separazione),"It's the first time it happened to me
In the past I locked myself in a box
Always a bit distant from the things of life
Because I never felt them too deeply
Then I felt an emotion lighting fast
And making itself a path in my chest without putting off its voice
And I don't feel tension any more, only life, inside me No degree of separation
No type of hesitation
There isn't any division between us any longer
We're a single direction in this world that moves There's no degree of separation
I gave less space to the heart and more to reason
Always a step back and with my soul on alert
And I watched the world from a door
That was never completely open
And from afar
And no, there's no hesitation, finally, inside me There is no degree of separation
There is no degree of hesitation
There is no degree of space between us
Live in love
We are stars aligned together
Dancing through the sky,
We are shining... (No degree of separation)
No degree of separation
In this world that moves... Then I felt an emotion lighting fast
And making itself a path in my chest without putting off its voice"
If I Were Sorry,"[Verse 1]
I'd crawl through the desert on my hands and knees
Rehearsing my ""pretty please""
Climb the highest mountain
If I were sorry
Shout it from the top
Swim underwater until my lungs exploded
Walk into the fire
If I were sorry

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'd run a thousand miles
Wouldn't stop until I dropped
Wouldn't take the break to breathe
Until I got close enough
And I'd do it all again
If I really had the chance
But I know deep inside for you
It's just another dance

[Chorus 1]
If I were sorry
I'd give you all the glory
If I were sorry
If I were sorry
It would be a different story
If I were sorry
If I were sorry, oh

[Verse 2]
I'd hold my breath 'til my face turned blue
I'd rob a bank and a post office too
Swim across the ocean
If I were sorry
I'd take a vow of silence
I wouldn't say a single word until you really heard
If I were sorry

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'd run a thousand miles
Wouldn't stop until I dropped
Wouldn't take the break to breathe
Until I, I got close enough

[Chorus 1]
If I were sorry
I'd give you all the glory
If I were sorry
If I were sorry
It would be a different story
If I were sorry
If I were sorry, oh

[Bridge]
Did you ever realize
That your mistake had a price?
Oh, you threw it all away
Cause you're the devil in disguise
Now would you ever realize
The consequences of your lies?
And would you save the falling tear
Or act as if there's nothing there?
If I were sorry
(If I were sorry)
If I were sorry
(If I were sorry)

[Chorus 2]
If I were sorry
I'd take a vow of silence
Wouldn't say a single word
(If I were sorry)
If I were sorry
I'd be on my hands and knees, beggin' ""pretty please""
If I were sorry
But I'm not sorry, no"

The story of us
Is it already told?
Let's tear the book apart
Start to rewrite it all
We're already gone
But still in this together
Like a dragon to its gold
We're still holding on

[Pre-Chorus]
Our life will wait for us to live
We don't need a lifetime to figure out what we miss
The love we get is the love we give
I'm only just full of love that we're here to give

This is the ghost of you
Haunting the ghost of me
Lonely in a crowded room together
Tell me who's scared now?

Haunting the ghost of me
Playing house in these walls forever
Tell me who's scared now?

[Post Chorus]
Can we get an alternate ending?
Can we get an alternate ending?
Oohh

[Verse 2]
Somehow we will change
Everything that we touch
But we held on too tight
And changed it too much
We sweep up this love
Put the pieces back together
And if we find more
Can we bring this to life?

Our life will wait for us to live
We don't need a lifetime to figure out what we miss

J'ai cherché,"You-ou-ou-ou-ou
You-ou-ou-ou-ou I was looking for a sense in my existence
I have lost my innocence in doing so
I finished my heart without defense
I was looking for Love and 	recognition

I hurt myself and start again You gave
Me like the need to be myself
Gave a sense to my why's
You killed the fear
Sleeping there, sleeping there
In my arms You-ou-ou-ou-ou

Like the melody of my song I was looking for a sense
A point of reference
Divided into two hemispheres
Like an error of the universe
I threw So many bottles into the sea
I drank so many bitter liquors
That I got lips of stone from it You gave
Me like the need to be me
Gave a sense to my why's
You killed the fear
Sleeping there, sleeping there

Say Yay!,"Hello, hello, Mr. Fighter
Look, there we go again
Go-getters don’t forsake
They never wallow in their fate

We’re never gonna know what lies ahead
We only got today
To learn from our yesterday

I feel alive (Bringing into play)
My whole life (Going all the way)

From broken mirrors

I feel alive (When I dare to say)
I wanna fight
Won’t fix by running, running, running

Of every time I fought them face to face
We go through our mistakes
To find the way to go back straight

My whole life (Going all the way)
I’m still alive (And I turn away)
From broken mirrors

Heartbeat, when you're not around it's beating slow

With just one look you make me shiver
I just wanna take you home
Wanna go, yeah I wanna go
Now girl, you make me a believer
I wanna take off all my clothes
Wanna go, you make me wanna go

I just can’t go on no more
When you look this freaking beautiful
Oh hands down to the floor, my love
And I’m doing whatever you want

When you look this freaking beautiful
I can’t go on, I can’t go on
When you look this freaking beautiful, woah

And I’m not going nowhere
Right in your hook, that’s understood
But I’ma take you to somewhere

When you look this freaking beautiful
Oh hands down to the floor, my love

Keep the Faith,"Who told you to hide behind the veil
Who told you to get out of the way
Don’t you let them steal your dreams
Feel the courage, spread your wings and breathe

Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Remember you are not alone
Hold my hand and come along

You keep the faith
Keep the faith
Don’t let nobody turn you down
Even if the world is rough

Who told you that I reached that point of no regrets?
Who told you that my life is a book of fairytales?
I have lost many times
But I’ve never lost my hope

Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Remember you are not alone
Hold my hand and come along

You keep the faith
Keep the faith
Don’t let nobody turn you down
Even if the world is rough

Oh, oh, oh!
You’ve got to stand on your own
Crowd hear me out
The world needs more love!

Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Remember you are not alone
Hold my hand and come along

You keep the faith
Keep the faith
Don’t let nobody turn you down
Even if the world is rough

Don't Come Easy,"[Verse 1]
I can tell by your eyes you want more than this
But can we be much more beyond these sheets?
No I don't, don't wanna mess with your head
But my love, it's hard to love again

[Chorus]
It don't come easy and it don't come cheap
Been burned too many times to love easily
Don't mistake me, my love runs deep
But it don't come easy, it don't come cheap
No, not with me

[Verse 2]
I used to move in fast to erase my past
But it never works, no, it never lasts, no
In my mind, I gotta get things right
Take it slow before I jump this time

[Chorus]
No, it don't come easy, no, it don't come cheap
Been burned too many times to love easily
Don't mistake me, my love runs deep
But it don't come easy, it don't come cheap
No, not with me

[Bridge]
And if you think I've got a heart of stone
You couldn't be more wrong, oh
You might think I've been afraid too long
Afraid of love

[Chorus]
But it don't come easy
Been burned too many times to love easily
Don't mistake me, my love runs deep
But it don't come easy, it don't come cheap

No, not with me
Oh no, not with me
Oh, don't mistake me, my love runs deep
But it don't come easy, it don't come cheap

World,"[Verse 1]
We're so alike, yet different
At a loss for words, stuttering
It don't make sense, what's happening?
I just don't understand

[Chorus]
What's the fight all for?
What's the cost of life in this world?
Almost impossible
Is to let the love unite us all

[Verse 2]
Does anybody care
I'm weak and I'm afraid
Wondering if I will make it through this day
For the life of me
I refuse to be
Anything but free
But I'm tired of all the battling
Ohh

[Chorus]
What's the fight all for?
What's the cost of life in this world?
Almost impossible
Is to let the love unite us all

(Let the love unite us all)
Oh, oh, uh
(Let the love unite us all)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Yeah, oh, oh
(What's the fight all for?)
(What's the cost of life In this world?)
(Almost impossible is to let the love unite us all )
What's the fight all for?
What's the cost of life In this world?
All I ever really want
Is to let the love unite us all"
City Lights,"[Chorus]
All alone in the danger zone
Are you ready to take my hand?
All alone in the flame of doubt
Are we going to lose it all?

[Verse 1]
I could never leave you in the city lights
I could never beat the storm in your eyes
The storm in your bright eyes

[Chorus]
All alone in the danger zone
Are you ready to take my hand?

Are we going to lose it all?

Looking in between the space in the city lights
All we ever seen is stars in your eyes
The stars in your dark eyes

[Chorus]
All alone in the danger zone
Are you ready to take my hand?
All alone in the flame of doubt
Are we going to lose it all?

[Bridge]
Let’s put some light in to our lives
Light keep us down until we rise
They threw some light in to our lives

[Chorus]
All alone in the danger zone
Are you ready to take my hand?
All alone in the flame of doubt
Are we going to lose it all?

All alone in the danger zone
Are you ready to take my hand?
All alone in the flame of doubt
Are we going to lose it all?

To lose it all?
To lose it all?"
Space,"[Verse 1]
Linen is covered with feathers
Wet dreams, wild nightmares, I surrender
Come in to me from within
We can be as one in the sin

The spaceship is ready to blow
Drunk in love I’m gonna explode
Be my Bonnie, we’ll mix and match with Clyde
Let’s explore this galaxy of stars
Let’s explore this galaxy of stars

[Chorus]
I have my suit on, no need to worry
Give me your body, let’s write a story

Blackbird, blackbird, don't sing to me
Don't sing below my window
Fly somewhere else, don't bother me

You sang when my heart sang
Now you remind me of something I'll never have
So blackbird, don't sing

Somewhere else go make your home
Don't nestle here, go find lovers of your own

Skeletons,"[Verse 1]
Standing in a mirror lane, wondering what to do
Another day and gravity’s got, got another hold of me
I never dreamed that this could be happening, not to me
But if he came falling down falling so hard, I started believing

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now I’m into daydreams, amazed by thorn jeans
Deep into high extremes
When I’m with him it’s fantasy, we’re just like alchemy
Oh I feel ready

[Chorus]
Have my skeletons (I can only trick you once, bad boy)
Have my lungs, my millions (Talk is cheap don’t speak in tongues, bad boy)
Drum drum drum, bring out the guns (Drum drum drum, bring out the guns, bad boy)
I’m so so cursed (Fuss and fight won’t get you tons)
Bad boy

[Verse 2]
The world is spinning faster by the minute and I’m longing to be saved
This bitter sweet sensation got a, got another hold of me

Now I’m stuck in daydreams, surrounded by thorn jeans
Deep into high extremes
When we hook up it’s fantasy, we’re just like alchemy
I’ve never been so ready

Amar pelos dois,"If one day someone asks about me
Say that I lived just to love you
Before you, I only existed
Tired and without a thing to offer My dear, listen to my prayers
I ask you to come back, that you come back to love me
I know we can't love alone
Maybe little by little you can learn again My dear, listen to my prayers
I ask you to come back, that you come back to love me
I know we can't love alone
Maybe little by little you can learn again If your heart doesn't wish to do so
To feel the passion, If it doesn't want to suffer
Without making plans about what will happen
My Heart can love for the both of us"
This Is Love,"Holding onto what we had can be so complicated
Could be time to move along and face it, no more debating
Watch the river running dry
Now it’s time to say goodbye

There’s an echo in my head
There’s a story still unread
And I need you here tonight

Walk away, don’t turn around
I will never let you down
I won’t let you see me cry

There’s an echo in my head
There’s a crossroad up ahead
And I want you here
Forever and ever and ever and ever
I’m not giving up

This is love
Reaching out for the stars
You and me as one
Everywhere, this is love

This is love

Holding on to what we had can be so self-destroying
Remember how we laughed played around ’til night met the morning?
Watch the sunset in the sky
There will never be goodbye

There’s an echo in my head
There’s a story still unread
And I need you here tonight

Walk away, don’t turn around
I will never let you down
Now I want you here
Forever and ever and ever and ever
I’m not giving up

This is love
Reaching out for the stars
You and me as one
Everywhere, this is love

This is love
Reaching out for the stars
You and me as one
This is love"
Flashlight,"[Verse 1]
Like a bullet from a smoking gun
They try to tell us that we don't belong
Creeping 'round at the depth of night
Just two shadows in love, we were ghosts
Two hearts, we're invincible
When we're together we're untouchable
Haunted by if it's wrong or right
Shadows in love, we were ghosts

[Pre-Chorus]
Fire
Like a burning desire
Taking me higher
Walk in a wire
We will never come down

[Chorus]
It's like a flashlight burning in our eyes
You call the dogs off, I got them hypnotized
You never catch us, take us by suprise
Running faster at the speed of light
Falling deeper, got you in the sight
Bringing down your eyes in the sky

[Verse 2]
Like two animals on the run
Not afraid to fly into the sun
Invisible, we don't leave a trace
We're shadows in love, we were ghosts

[Pre-Chorus]
Fire
Like a burning desire
Taking me higher
Walk in a wire
We will never come down

[Chorus]
It's like a flashlight burning in our eyes
You call the dogs off, I got them hypnotized
You never catch us, take us by suprise
Running faster at the speed of light
Falling deeper, got you in a sight
Bringing down your eyes in the sky

My Turn,"From the very very first time I saw you
You were my home, you were home, you were my home

Now that you are falling, let me be your calling, be your one prayer, keep away the bad things
In this moment let me give to you what you’ve given to me, that’s the least I can do

Baby it’s you
Every time I close my eyes
It’s always been you
Heaven knows that I’ll be waiting always by your side
Baby it’s you
Every time that I was down
You were there to fix me up
You were there to pick me up
Now it’s my turn

Oh I was your choice, I was your choice, so let me be your salvation and joy

You know that I love it when you call, just to say hello, oh oh
Will you let me hear it, once more"

In Too Deep,"Wish that I knew where I lost
Right where there was no going back
The line was crossed

So here I am, right at your door
Catching my breath before the storm

Breathlessly
I’ll be watching you breathlessly
Knowing there’s a vacancy within your heart

Breathlessly
I’ll be holding you endlessly
Knowing that the storm is just about to die
Climbing over walls that always felt too high
Breathlessly

I’m stepping out
Yet I feel I’m locked inside
I’ve got the will, I learned the skill
Of a true acrobat for love

Breathlessly
I’ll be watching you breathlessly
Knowing there’s a vacancy within your heart

Breathlessly
I’ll be holding you endlessly
Knowing that the storm is just about to die
Climbing over walls that always felt too high
Breathlessly"
Yodel It!,"[Verse 1: Alex]

[Verse 2: Alex]
You never show the spark that makes you glow
You always run away, you always say no to the right things
Don’t try to hide the light inside of you
Today might be the day when you will make it baby

[Pre-Chorus: Ilinca & Alex]
So bring it on, bring it on, I’m a dreamer
If you don’t believe it, come and see me I will teach you
If you never try, you’ll never be alive
You are gonna miss out on this ride

Now what’s the use of being so confused
Of doing all this work you really don’t want to be doing
But you’ll be fine, it’s time to feel alive
Don’t stop from reaching for the stars and keep on moving
So bring it on, bring it on, I’m a dreamer
If you don’t believe it, come and see me, I will teach ya
If you never try, you’ll never be alive
You are gonna miss out on this ride!

[Bridge 2]
Sitting alone at my desk on a 9 to 5 program
It just won’t do
Get another coffee, get another one to make it through
Don’t want this anymore
Don’t you hide that light inside of you
Come and show me what you wanna do
If you’re stuck in a place feeling incomplete
If you wanna run feeling like a misfit
Come on sing along
Come on sing this song
Say 1, 2, 3

[Outro]
Yodelei, yodeleio
Just shout it baby
Yodelei, yodeleio
Just shout it baby
Yodeleeii
Wanna hear this now
Yodeleio
Gonna act really crazy
Yodeleeii
Yodele yodeleioo
Just shout it baby"
Lights and Shadows,"Songtekst van O'G3NE - Lights And Shadows

[Intro: All]
Cry no more, cry no more

[Verse 1: Shelley + Lisa + All]
Though the hallway catches light
It won't reach the corner where you strongly fight
Here in the shadow
At this place they know the game
Outside the world will turn and feel the same
There in the sunlight

[Pre-Chorus 1: All + Amy]
But you are so much more to me
Than the one who carries all the burden
I can only hope once you fly you'll be free
You should never...

[Chorus: All]
Cry no more, feeling all alone and insecure
You have been going through these stages
Now it's time to turn the pages
We're gonna stand in line
And not give up but walk that road
That everybody goes
Through lights and shadows

[Verse 2: Shelley + Lisa + All]
Every time the candle glows
It lightens up the space but no one knows
Will there be a dark side?
Every battle's victory
Is a double feeling when you cannot be
Here in the spotlight

[Pre-Chorus 2: All + Amy]
Cause you are so much more to me
Than the one who lifts us on your shoulders
I can only hope once you fly you'll be free
You should never...

[Chorus: All]
Cry no more, feeling all alone and insecure
You have been going through these stages
Now it's time to turn the pages
We're gonna stand in line
And not give up but walk that road
That everybody goes
Through lights and shadows

[Bridge: Lisa + Amy + Shelley + All]
On a scale of one to ten
You got the biggest score, you're heaven sent
No one will doubt that you're an angel
So what went wrong this time?
Hurt nobody, did no crime
What's with the universe, why you?

[Chorus: All]
Cry no more, feeling all alone and insecure
You have been going through these stages
Now it's time to turn the pages
We're gonna stand in line
And not give up but walk that road
That everybody goes
Through lights and shadows"
Origo,"You need to close your eyes,
so you will see me.
You need to know my soul,
To conquer my heart. If you don't need me, let me leave
I was born a loafer.
I had already suffered enough,
but God sees my life. Yaloma lomma, yaloma lomma
Yaloma lomma lomalom
Yaloma lomma, yaloma nedinna
Yaloma lomma, lomalom Why did you lie to me that,
Doesn't the color of skin matter?
You know that I've brown eyes,
It is invariably. I'm not asking at you more
Get out of here, leave me!
I don't wanna seeing you.
I curse you forever. Yaloma lomma, yaloma lomma
Yaloma lomma lomalom
Yaloma lomma, yaloma nedinna
Yaloma lomma, lomalom God was talking with me, when I was 4 years old.
I knew only he can take care of me
I was practicing with it a lot like a samurai.
I can trust Him, he will always tell the truth
I can cry with Him, and he will show the way.
This alliance will remain forever
We are inseparable, he is the most supreme treasure. Mysterious forces were in childhood.
They were afraid of him, he appears in the eyes.
The strings are attacked, the body is crying
You defend yourself unnecessarily, as if it is a poison in a instrument.
She is soaked it from people
you can hear the melody you know my name.
It's a long road, I've sores on my back
Tears of Thousand people are played in my guitar."
Where I Am,"[Verse 1]
You're lost in my game
But your love is repeating
Always around, you're never holding me down
I know who you are
True colours are showing
Though my heart's bare
Always show you care

[Pre-Chorus]
Putting up my walls so that I last better
Don't know why I do it because we're together
Always holding back from you, it's on my mind

Tonight I'm gonna try for you real harder
Show you all the love I've held inside
Show you all the love I've held inside
Let's do it right

[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna show you, show you what you've done
I'm laying down my armour, laying down my gun
Tonight I'm gonna hold you closer than before
So you know where I am
So you know where I am

[Verse 2]
I've known it's not right
Just couldn't reveal it
Always closing up tight
And never releasing

Afraid and I fear to love
But you never let me go
I've held it in my heart
But now I'm letting you know

[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna show you, show you what you've done
I'm laying down my armour, laying down my gun
Tonight I'm gonna hold you closer than before
So you know where I am
So you know where I am

[Bridge]
Putting up my walls so that I last better
I don't know why I do it because we're together

Tonight I'm gonna try for you real harder
Show you all the love I've held inside
Show you all the love I've held inside
Lets do it right

[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna show you, show you what you've done
I'm laying down my armour, laying down my gun
Tonight I'm gonna hold you closer than before
So you know where I am
So you know where I am

So you know where I am
So you know where I am
So you know where I am (So you know where I am)
Oh, so you know where I am"
Dying to Try,"Take a leap of faith with me
If you believe honestly
That I am yours and you are mine
I know you’re scared, and so am I

‘Cause I know that love can be so strong
And yet so frail
And there ain’t no guarantee
That you and me won’t fail

But I’m dying to try
I’m dying to try
I’ll keep you safe in my arms
Build a bridge to your heart every day

I’ll give you it all
But I’m not gonna lie
‘Cause no one can promise
That love will ever learn how to fly
Will ever learn how to fly, oh…

But I’m dying to try
But I’m dying to try
(‘Cause no one can promise)
(That love will ever learn how to fly) Yeah…

I’m dying to try
I’m dying to try
I’ll keep you safe in my arms
Build a bridge to your heart every day

I’ll give you it all
But I’m not gonna lie
Oh, ’cause no one can promise
That love will ever learn how to fly

Oh, ’cause no one can promise
That love will ever learn how to fly
But I’m dying to try
Take a leap if you believe"
Spirit of the Night,"Hey, are you the one I dream about?
Baby, I am
I really feel the night can take away my doubt
I’ll try and do what I can

Every time I see you smile there is a sadness in your eyes
Well I’ve been hurt before
I know it’s nothing new and time will make you realise
We always wish for more

We find we’re searching high and low
And always looking for the right time
Together we can make it through the night

It’s the spirit of the night, spirit of the night
Burning like St. Elmo’s fire
Spirit of the night, takes our feelings so much higher

It’s the spirit of the night
(Spirit of the night, spirit of the night)
We can live our fantasy
Spirit of the night, burning in our ecstasy
(Spirit of the night)

Hey, are you the one to take my pain?
Just take my hand
I’ve been so hurt before, it’s hard to trust again (Trust again)
You know I understand

You’ve got me feeling right (Feeling right)
And I can see the future is bright
I’ll take your blues away

So no more searching high and low
And always looking for the right time (Right time)
Together we (We) can (can) make it through the night

It’s the spirit of the night, spirit of the night
Burning like St. Elmo’s fire
Spirit of the night, takes our feelings so much higher
Feed our deep desire

It’s the spirit of the night
(It’s a feeling, got me reeling)
We can live our fantasy

It’s the spirit of the night
(It’s a feeling, just a feeling)
Burning in our ecstasy

Time to celebrate our love
We’re caught in its ray of light
Calling to the world out loud
Just let our spirits fly (Spirits fly)

We can write another page
A golden age within our lifetime

It’s the spirit of the night (Spirit of the night)
It’s the spirit of the night
It’s the spirit of the night
Takes our feelings so much higher and higher

It’s the spirit of the night, spirit of the night
Burning in our ecstasy
Spirit of the night, we can live our fantasy"
My Friend,"There are only two ways to live your life
One is as though nothing is a miracle
The other is as though everything’s a miracle

There’s a miracle my friend
And it happens every day
Hold out your hand
Don’t let it slip away

Io so che esiste
Guarda meglio su
Ritorna ogni giorno
Promettendo sempre più
After the rain

Nasce il sole
I pray you see the light and find your way

La forza del destino che è in te

Do your best
Take a chance
Dare to dream and
Make it real
Segui la verità, via della libertà
My friend
My friend

Don’t let go
Let it flow

Credi nel miracolo

For the miracle
That I’m talking of
Is the life that we’re given

La vita vincera

I pray you see the light and find your way
I pray, I pray

La forza del destino che è in te

Do your best
Take a chance
Dare to dream and make it real

Grab the Moment,"[Verse 1]
They read me like a book that is open
While punching on a bag and I’m choking
I’m looking for a sign while they’re stepping on my mind
But I hide behind a simpleminded notion
I'm trying to act cool but I’m boiling
I'm feeling like a fool that was chosen
Try to keep myself calm
While my head was getting bombed
Really need to get that good vibe going

[Pre-Chorus]
So when it’s all or nothing
I put my nerves in the coffin
So when it’s all or nothing
I put my nerves in the coffin

[Chorus]
I’m gonna kill that voice in my head
I don’t care about falling
I’m gonna grab the moment
I’m gonna kill that voice in my head
I don’t care about falling
I’m gonna grab the moment

[Post-Chorus]
I’m, I’m, gonna gonna
Kill kill kill kill, that
Voice in my head
I don’t care, I don’t care

[Verse 2]
Getting kinda heavy on my shoulders
Try to stand straight but I’m boneless
Got a pocketful of prose while I’m walking on my toes
And I’m coping with a map that is roadless
Got eyes in my neck but I’m absent
I’m quiet in a corner seeking action
I wanna be bold but I’m only getting old
I need to stop drowning in distractions

[Pre-Chorus]
So when it’s all or nothing
I better get that good vibe buzzing
So when it’s all or nothing
I get that good vibe buzzing

[Chorus]
I’m gonna kill that voice in my head
I don’t care about falling
I’m gonna grab the moment
I’m gonna kill that voice in my head
I don’t care about falling
I’m gonna grab the moment

[Post-Chorus]
I’m, I’m, gonna gonna
Kill kill kill kill, that
Voice in my head
I don’t care, I don’t care
I’m, I’m, gonna gonna
Kill kill kill kill, that
Voice in my head
I don’t care, I don’t care

[Bridge]
Hidden deep in that beat
There’s a calling for that leap
Got no control but I know
There’s a fire in my soul
Hidden deep in that beat
There’s a calling for that leap
Got no control but I know
There’s a fire in my soul

[Chorus]
I’m gonna kill that voice in my head
I don’t care about falling
I’m gonna grab the moment
I’m gonna kill that voice in my head
I don’t care about falling
I’m gonna grab the moment"
Apollo,"Like a bullet in my chest
You’re written, bound and etched
Forever in my mind

We are fading in our hands
Lost somewhere in a wasteland
Not knowing up from down

But when the walls are caving
And the world keeps turning
We got the love, we got to love

Now I will never let you go
All the words won’t make me fold
It is never easy
I’ll follow you, Apollo

Now I will never let you go
Give it time and we will grow
Ain’t no fun in easy
I’ll follow you, Apollo
I’ll follow you, Apollo

I wear my heart on my sleeve
You do the same for me
When autumn comes around

But when the walls are caving
And the world keeps turning
We got the love, we got to love

Now I will never let you go
All the words won’t make me fold
It is never easy
I’ll follow you, Apollo

Now I will never let you go
Give it time and we will grow
Ain’t no fun in easy
I’ll follow you, Apollo
I’ll follow you-u

So don’t pull the rug from underneath us
We’re in trouble babe, but we got the love
Don’t pull the rug from underneath us
Crashing down fast, as fragile as glass

But what are we now if we never tried?
What are we now?

I will never let you go
Give it time and we will grow
It is not supposed to be easy

Now I will never let you go
Give it time and we will grow
Ain’t no fun in easy
I’ll follow you, Apollo
I’ll follow you, Apollo

You, Apollo
It is never easy
I’ll follow you, Apollo
I’ll follow you, Apollo

You, Apollo
It is never easy
I’ll follow you, Apollo
I’ll follow you, Apollo"
Story of My Life (Historyja majho žyccia) (Гісторыя майго жыцця),"How many days, how many dates of love
New images and towns
The chain of events, leaves behind us
We keep it in our hearts and walk on The story of my life
Will shine even brighter
Our blood will sparkle wtih the sun inside
And all the beauty of our eyes Wherever you are I will find you
We'll discover the bright moments sooner
Today will give birth
To new desirs and better ideas The story of my life
Will shine even brighter
Our blood will sparkle wtih the sun inside
And all the beauty of our eyes"
Beautiful Mess,"[Verse 1]
When the world shakes us
Trying to take us out of line
Fear of tomorrow
Feelings we borrow for a time

[Refrain]
Water so deep, how do we breathe?
How do we climb?
So we stay in this mess
This beautiful mess tonight

[Chorus]
And we don’t have a thing to lose
No matter what they say or do
I don’t want nothing more
Our love is untouchable
Even in the line of fire
When everything is on the wire
Even up against the wall
Our love is untouchable
Our love is untouchable

[Verse 2]
When the colours turn grey and the lights all fade
To black again
We’re in over our heads
But somehow we make it back again

[Refrain]
Water so deep, how do we breathe?
How do we climb?
So we stay in this mess
This beautiful mess tonight

[Chorus]
And we don’t have a thing to lose
No matter what they say or do
I don’t want nothing more
Our love is untouchable
Even in the line of fire
When everything is on the wire
Even up against the wall
Our love is untouchable

[Brigde]
Ohhhh
Ohhh no no no
Even in the line of fire
When everything is on the wire
Even up against the wall
Our love is untouchable"
Rain of Revolution,"Life like roller coaster spinning me around
Rhythm getting faster when I’m upside down
Changes running through me with the speed of sound
There’s no wait in dream life, nothing stops me now

Making a start, making a start
Making a start and let the light shine through me
Thinking it out, making a vow
Breaking irrational fears that are with me

Now I’m getting closer to you
Feel the rain of revolution
Now I’m getting closer to you
There’s no time for your illusion now

Yeah yeah…
Yeah yeah… yeah yeah… yeah yeah…
Yeah yeah… yeah yeah… yeah yeah…
Yeah yeah… yeah yeah… yeah yeah…

Looking for the reason I’m still on the road
If I’m gonna stop and choose, yeah yeah…
I feel I’m gonna travel again

Making a start, making a start
Making a start and let the light shine through me

Dance to the rhythm of the soul
Dance to the rhythm of the soul
Dance to the rhythm of the soul
Dance to the rhythm of the soul

Now I’m getting closer to you
Feel the rain of revolution
Now I’m getting closer to you
There’s no time for your illusion now

Yeah yeah…
Yeah yeah… yeah yeah… yeah yeah…
Yeah yeah… yeah yeah… yeah yeah…
Yeah yeah… yeah yeah… yeah yeah…"
Verona,"Sleeping all alone
You wake up with a bottle in your hands
No sound of serenade cause we both know we lost our game
I was always high on loving you
Before the romance turned to drama
Like Romeo and Juliet once before
We are lost in Verona

Learning through the scars
Will make you stronger time is the proof
I'm not a loner kind
I know I just can't get over you

I was always trying to tell the truth
Before the romance turned to drama
I hope the best in me was always you
Before we lost our Verona

We are lost
Lost in the crowd of the street
We are lost
Like two sailing boats in the sea
We are lost
Cause sometimes we building and burning down love
We are lost our Verona

Ooooooooooooo
We lost and we found our Verona
Ooooooooooooo
We are lost in Verona

Reckless type of love, reckless type of love
We never said I'm sorry
We never said enough
This western type of woman; western type of man
Disappeared in Verona

Ooooooooooooo
We lost and we found our Verona
Ooooooooooooo
We are lost in Verona

We are lost
Lost in the crowd of the street
We are lost
Like two sailing boats in the sea
We are lost
Cause sometimes we building and burning down love
We are lost our Verona

Ooooooooooooo
We lost and we found our Verona
Ooooooooooooo
We are lost in Verona"
I Feel Alive,"[Verse 1]
The secret of my life is never giving up
Now I’m close to you
Walking through the stars brings me to the start
When I won with you

[Pre-Chorus]
I was waiting way too much for something good to come
And I’m a bit fragile
Was waiting way too much, it’s like an hourglass
And you like trouble

[Chorus]
Breaking me to pieces
I wanted you to know that every piece broke from you
Breaking me to pieces
‘Cause every time you come around
I feel alive

[Post-Chorus]
Now I’m trying, I’m trying
I feel alive
I feel alive

[Verse 2]
The years I’ve been alone far away from home
Reminded me of you
My job is almost done
Baby, I can now escape away with you

[Pre-Chorus]
I was waiting way too much for something good to come
And I’m a bit fragile
Was waiting way too much, it’s like an hourglass
And you like trouble

[Chorus]
Breaking me to pieces
I wanted you to know that every piece broke from you
Breaking me to pieces
‘Cause every time you come around
I feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I’m trying, I’m trying
I feel alive
So alive

[Bridge]
Alive, alive, alive
Alive, alive, alive

[Chorus]
Breaking me to pieces
I wanted you to know that every piece broke from you
Breaking me to pieces
‘Cause every time you come around
I feel alive"

Do it for your lover, do it for your lover baby, clap your hands and do it for your lover,

Perfect Life,"I come alive inside the light of the unexpected
Maybe I thrive outside the comfort zone
What is a prize without a fight? Yeah, I got addicted
To what I thought I wanted, and all along…

I’ve been walking asleep, dreaming awake
Finding I bend but I don’t break
I’m almost a sinner, nearly a saint
Finding with every breath I take
I’m not afraid of making mistakes
Sometimes it’s wrong before it’s right
That’s what you call a perfect life

Gathering thorns from the stems of a thousand roses
Weathering storms on the long way home
I look for the sweet in every bitter moment tasted
In every last mistake I see the other side

I’ve been walking asleep, dreaming awake
Finding I bend but I don’t break
I’m almost a sinner, nearly a saint
Finding with every breath I take
I’m not afraid of making mistakes
Sometimes it’s wrong before it’s right
That’s what you call a perfect
And that’s what you call a perfect
And that’s what you call a perfect life

I’ve been walking asleep, dreaming awake
Finding I bend but I don’t break
I’m almost a sinner, nearly a saint
Finding with every breath I take
I’m not afraid of making mistakes
Sometimes it’s wrong before it’s right
And that’s what you call a perfect
That’s what you call a perfect
That’s what you call a perfect life"
Time,"Slow down
Give me some time
Turn down
The volume of your cry
Let's take time to find
A place without violence
Let’s listen and hear
The true meaning of silence

Time to look
Time to see
Time to find

Time to look into your eyes
Time to find truth
Time against the lies
Time will give us a sign
I can make a promise
It’s our time to shine

Just listen
Take a look around
Stop missing
The things you haven’t found
You will realize
There’s no common ground
There’s no compromise
Between the time and sound"
Requiem,"Love dies, love is born
Centuries pass and disappear
What you believe to be dead
It's a season and nothing more One day tired of this wandering
You will go away, no matter
Because the world will still turn
Even when we won't turn anymore Kiss me, tell me that you love me
Make me smile right in the middle of a requiem
Kiss me, tell me that you love me
Make me dance until time takes back from us
What it had given Would you take me to paradise
With you nothing ever dies
You take my smile and make it bright
Before the night erases the light
I won't go below silver skies
The only darkness is in your eyes 
We cry but we still survive
It's the beauty of a requiem Sparks become flames
Little girls become women
What you believe to be love
It's a fire and nothing more Our heartbreaks, our declines
They're thought to be important
But tomorrow the day will be reborn
Like if we had not lived Kiss me, tell me that you love me
Make me smile in the middle of a requiem
Kiss me, tell me that you love me
Make me dance until time takes back from us
What it had given Would you take me to paradise
With you nothing ever dies
You take my smile and make it bright
Before the night erases the light
I won't go below silver skies
The only darkness is in your eyes 
We cry but we still survive
It's the beauty of a requiem Love is born, love dies
Tonight, I'm finally no longer afraid
I know that I will love you again
When the world won't turn anymore Love is born, love dies
Tonight, I'm finally no longer afraid
I know that I will love you again
When the world won't turn anymore Kiss me, tell me that you love me
Make me smile in the middle of a requiem
Kiss me, tell me that you love me
Make me dance until time takes back from us
What it had given Kiss me
Tell me that you love me
Kiss me Kiss me
Tell me that you love me
Kiss me"
X My Heart,"[Verse 1]
I can hear you when I wake
I can see you when I dream
I can feel you when I break
As you hold me, as you beam
Every night you fill the sky with new revelations
Misty moon, I'm your loon
Let's rock the nation

[Pre-Chorus]
Heaven knows we are
Made perfect we are
Tailored by the stars
Once we set our mind
We become divine
Take my hand, it's time

[Chorus]
I cross my heart, I tear down the firewalls
I cross my heart, I'm stronger than cannonballs
I'll never sto-o-o-o-op
Luna moon me up, to the to-o-op
I'll never sto-o-o-o-op
Luna moon me up, to the to-o-op

[Verse 2]
If you're stuck in all the noise
Let me be your secret voice
If you think that you don't count
Let me prove you different now

[Pre-Chorus]
Heaven knows we are
Made perfect we are
Tailored by the stars
Once we set our mind
We become divine
Take my hand, it's time

[Chorus]
I cross my heart, I tear down the firewalls
I cross my heart, I'm stronger than cannonballs
I'll never sto-o-o-o-op
Luna moon me up, to the to-o-op
I'll never sto-o-o-o-op
Luna moon me up, to the to-o-op

I cross my heart, I tear down the firewalls
I cross my heart, I'm stronger than cannonballs
I'll never sto-o-o-o-op
Luna moon me up, to the to-o-op
I'll never sto-o-o-o-op
Luna moon me up, to the to-o-op

[Outro]
I cross my heart"
Our Choice,"[Verse 1]
All the faces you see on your way
Have a story they could tell
Tiny traces of life’s joy and sorrow
Why can’t we treat each other well

[Chorus]
We all have a choice we can make
There’s always a choice we can make
To help and to heal in different ways
Too many are dying in vain
Together we could ease the pain
If somehow we could ease the pain

[Post-Chorus]
In every single language
There’s a word for love and for blame
Different voices, cultures, and people, and places
Inside we’re all the same

[Chorus]
We all have a choice we can make
There’s always a choice we can make
To help and to heal in different ways
Too many are dying in vain
Together we could ease the pain
If somehow we could ease the pain

[Verse 2]
We’ve only got each other now
Don’t walk away and play pretend
It might as well be you
Who’s suffering tonight

[Chorus]
We all have a choice we can make
There’s always a choice we can make
To help and to heal in different ways
Too many are dying in vain
Together we could ease the pain
If somehow we could ease the pain

[Outro]
Together we could make a change"
Mall,"A long wait
sweet and fiery
A few steps beat like a heart tonight
I follow her rhythm
Two hands that guide feel the warmth
This yearning that burns doesn`t know boundaries nor distance Nothing in this world can explain this feeling
when two hearts unite and beat like one I want to hush tonight lay in this bed
where the divine dreams heal every wound.
To see her portrait
Moments pass by
seconds don`t forgive
hours go but they can`t stop the feeling, no As by magic, the moon gazes our stares
it brings me your vision. Undried tear, enlighten this night
resound today from the silent soul.
Just a moment the pain stops me
This undried tear will drain one day
from the fiery kisses it dreamed
at that moment the pain will stop. Sweet this life, but it knows no boundaries
sometimes it caresses us, sometimes it separates us
I have you far away
You make me fight when my powers have given out
I dream of you even when I am awake As by magic, the moon gazes our stares
our eyes meet again, even though it is a fantasy
I will give my life to you."
A Matter of Time,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes it feels like it's meant to be broken
Sometimes we long for the unspoken
We try to avoid every commotion
By showing hardly any emotion
Sometimes it seems we're at the wrong station
Looking for a deadly combination
Sometimes it feels like imagination
Looking for all these cheap sensations

[Pre-Chorus]
Why don't we go against the tide?
Against all their advice
We keep running, we keep on running
It's just a matter of time

[Chorus]
Before it all echos, echos, and goes
Crashing against the walls
Hold my hand and keep your eyes closed
Before it all echos, echos, and goes
I suppose it's just a matter of time

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it feels like it's meant to be broken
Sometimes we act like we've already chosen
We try to retrieve something stolen
By remembering how it used to be golden

[Pre-Chorus]
Why don't we go against the tide?
Against all their advice
We keep running, we keep on running
It's just a matter of time

[Chorus]
Before it all echos, echos and goes
Crashing against the walls
Hold my hand and keep your eyes closed
Before it all echos, echos and falls
I suppose it's just a matter of time
Before it all echos, echos, and goes
Crashing against the walls
Hold my hand and keep your eyes closed
Before it all echos, echos, and goes
I suppose it's just a matter of time"
Lie to Me,"[Verse 1]
Oh, oh she a good girl at home
But her skirt goes up like Marilyn Monroe's
Papa likes the drama, mama hotter than lava
She rocking high heels Prada, her face like Madonna
By the way she moved, got me making a puddle
Baby, I already knew you would be nothing but a trouble
Dammit, everybody knows she never loved for real
Honey bunny up all night wannabe couple goals queen

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you 'bop-whop-a-lu bop' on his wood bamboo
When you were still seeing me and well he didn't even knew hmm
But Goddammit, come and count to three, now sit down GGY
I'm on fire

[Chorus]
So come and lie to me
Lie to me, oh baby, come a little closer
Lie to me
Lie to me, oh baby, lean upon my shoulder
Lie to me
Get down on my body and love me like it was always meant to be
Now you love somebody new, I always knew
So come and give it to me

[Verse 2]
When the beat dropped, she dropped, dropped it like it's hot
And now without a second thought she got me doing what I'm not
Then it got heavy, mom I'm feeling home already
But steady plenty motherfuckers wanna eat my spaghetti
Then she got one of my friends
She got him dripping on wood
I know it hurt so bad but it feels so good
Quit sweet talking me now baby I don't give a fuck
You should've thought about me before you fucked him at the club

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you 'bop-whop-a-lu bop' on his wood bamboo
When you were still seeing me and well he didn't even knew hmm
But Goddammit, come and count to three, now sit down GGY
I'm on fire

[Chorus]
So come and lie to me
Lie to me, oh baby, come a little closer
Lie to me
Lie to me, oh baby, lean upon my shoulder
Lie to me
Get down on my body and love me like it was always meant to be
Now you love somebody new, I always knew
So come and give it to me

[Bridge]
You know I like it
When you lie, lie, lie
You look so good
When you lie, lie, lie
Set my camel in the mood
When you lie, lie, lie
When you lie, lie, lie

[Chorus]
So come and lie to me
Lie to me, oh baby, come a little closer
Lie to me
Lie to me, oh baby, lean upon my shoulder
Lie to me
Get down on my body and love me like it was always meant to be
Now you love somebody new, I always knew
So come and give it to me"
When We're Old (Kol myliu),"[Verse 1]
I know I'll never forget
That day the first time we met
We've come a long way since then
And I would do it all again
From your very first smile
I knew that I'd walk a mile
See, it's for real when you know
You never wanna let go

[Chorus]
These are the reasons
I want you to know
You make this place feel like home
These are the reasons
I can't let you go, oh oh
Let's sing this song that we wrote
When we're old, ah ah
When we're old, ah ah

[Verse 2]
No matter what comes our way
I feel like you're here to stay
You were there right from the start
And let me inside your heart
After all this time
I hate the sound of goodbye
And if you leave, I would...

[Chorus]
These are the reasons
I want you to know
You make this place feel like home
These are the reasons
I can't let you go, oh oh
Let's sing this song that we wrote
When we're old, ah ah
When we're old, ah ah

Right from our very first kiss
I knew it'll end up like this
I'm not afraid to grow old
If I have your hand to hold"

Forever,"[Verse 1]
It must be something that we call love
Wherever I go I'm coming back
And time cannot knock me off my track
This resolution is final
It must be something that we call love
It's when you're craving to say her name
And my reality seems to break apart with her arrival

[Chorus]
No need to worry, rain falling down
It's our happiest story and there's no one around
We will go for it and I know you'll be mine forever
Windows wide open, flying so high
Both of us roaming through magnificent sky
Rain keeps on falling and I know you'll be mine forever

[Verse 2]
It must be something that we call dream
When all you told me, I know by heart
The type of beauty I call supreme
And how it's driving me crazy

[Chorus]
No need to worry, rain falling down
It's our happiest story and there's no one around
We will go for it and I know you'll be mine forever
Windows wide open, flying so high
Both of us roaming through magnificent sky
Rain keeps on falling and I know you'll be mine forever

[Bridge]
You'll always sing me something new
I will always follow
When I first saw you here I knew
That I was blind before you

[Chorus]
No need to worry, rain falling down
It's our happiest story and there's no one around
We will go for it and I know you'll be mine forever
Windows wide open, flying so high
Both of us roaming through magnificent sky
Rain keeps on falling and I know you'll be mine forever"
La forza,"You know in the night for me
A star is there
You clear the way
For eternity
It is my guide
an immensity
That never leaves me The force of Destiny
Vaulting makes me
The hour is near to happiness
Is it a dream or reality
Our affinity
On the wings of love rising When I go that way
Always free
I would like it to be a fairy tale around us
Our love
Guide to us
In the infinite
For eternity The force of Destiny
Vaulting makes me
The hour is near to happiness
Is it a dream or reality
Our affinity
On the wings of love rising"
Bones,"[Verse 1]
Love is like a black hole
Everything is dark
You just gotta let go
And feel it, feel it, feel it
We fell off the deep end
Just to get a rush
You know that it's right when
You feel it, feel it, feel it

[Pre-Chorus]
What is life if it's just of the earth
Only of the flesh and bones
Wanna thrive in the dust of the universe
And way into unknown

So I love beyond the bones
Goes deep inside your soul
I love beyond the bones
I love beyond the bones
I love beyond the bones

[Verse 2]
Wanna be the fire
Even if it burns
Offer up my fibers
To feel it, feel it, feel it

What is life if it's just of the earth
Only of the flesh and bones
Wanna thrive in the dust of the universe
And way into unknown

Goes deep inside your soul
I love beyond the bones
Goes deep inside your soul
I love beyond the bones
I love beyond the bones
I love beyond the bones

Into the unknown
Where no other love goes
I love, I love beyond the bones"

And remove my blue
If you talk about my mountains
My loneliness will listen to  you How would you like me to say this
I would die for you
I would give my life for you
End and beginning, you are everything However much I may hurt
I would never remove you from the map

So tonight I'm making friends
With all the creatures that are hiding there under my bed

Qami (Քամի),"Deaf and dumb wind
When the soul is deep in the abyss
My friend becomes lonely What value does your love have?
He gives this simple question
In the clouds, they take your image What are the crazy wounds?
That opened your love,
By closing myself Wind, wind
Where did you take my warm memories?
Wind, wind
Give me wings to follow you
Wind I close my eyes
And it seems that I see
The path that leads you The stars were the liars
They said they were innocent
Love is the soul that looks for light Wind, wind
Where did you take my warm memories?
Wind, wind
Give me your wings to follow you Wind (Give me wings, give me wings)
Wind (That I'm going up) Wind (Give me wings, give me wings)
(That I'm going up) Wind (Give me wings, give me wings)
(That I'm going up) Wind (Give me wings, give me wings)

Stones,"[Verse 1]
Wild joker on a gold throne
Blood diamond, summer home
Wrong people with the right to know
But I can’t do anything about it
All saying that life’s hard
Don’t want it in our backyard
We should be further from the start
But I can’t do anything about it

[Pre-Chorus]
We so afraid, we fire away
What’s a life’s worth?
We so afraid, repeat the mistake
Just to come first

Every lesson lost in the past
Pardon me but I don’t wanna go back
No I ain’t throwing stones
No I ain’t throwing stones

Think the boogie man will get me
Think different is the enemy
It’s been this way for centuries
And I can’t do anything about it

And I can’t do anything about it

No I ain’t throwing stones
No I ain’t throwing
No I ain’t throwing stones"
Together,"[Verse 1]
We were drifting like two icebergs out on the ocean
I was doing all I could to keep you close
There were troubles in the water
You swore it was nothing
You said that we would always stay afloat

[Pre-Chorus]
Why would true love, look me in the eye and lie, lie?

[Chorus]
I thought we'd be together 'til we die
I'll forever wonder why
I thought we'd be together 'til we die
I'll forever wonder why

[Verse 2]
Why have you been coming home so late in the evening?
Is there someone else that I should know about?
'Cause there's a smile on your face that I haven't seen
Since we started going out

[Pre-Chorus]
How could true love, look me in the eye and lie, lie?

[Chorus]
I thought we'd be together 'til we die
I'll forever wonder why
I thought we'd be together 'til we die
I'll forever wonder why
I'll forever wonder why

[Bridge]
We said ""Until death do us part""
And then you chose to break my heart
Remember right back to the start
When we said we'd be together 'til we die
I'll forever wonder why
I thought we'd be together 'til we die
I'll forever wonder why

[Outro]
You said we'd be together 'til we die
I'll forever wonder why
I thought we'd be together 'til we die
I'll forever wonder why
I'll forever wonder why"

That's How You Write a Song,"[Verse 1]
If you got a minute
Get down your idea
It may do wonders
Maybe disappear
Who knows? Just get it down
And nothing can go wrong
Go find your rhythm
That’s how you write a song (hello)

Goodbye,"[Verse 1]
It’s time
For me to say goodbye
It’s fine
I’ve tried a million times
To kiss
The emptiness
And make her mine

[Verse 2]
I should’ve stayed
But I already left a thousand times
I’ve won my fights
Nobody knew nothin’ about
All alone
Trapped in a void
Can’t see the light
Goodbye

[Chorus 1]
Why don’t you see the beauty that surrounds you everywhere
Why can’t you feel the joy in all the small things people share
And all the happiness, that by the way is all for free
Open your heart, receive the love and stay with me

[Bridge]
Please
Don’t be afraid
I hear your cry
Don’t cry

[Chorus 2]
We should all see the beauty of the precious gifts we have
‘Cause everyone deserves the power to go straight ahead
Never give up, don’t hit the floor, don’t trust in all the lies
No matter what the odds will bring you, please don’t say goodbye"

Who We Are,"[Verse 1: Jessika]
Bullied from the moment we were born
We were always on our own
No one ever said we should be proud
Or embrace the fact of standing out
Forward too long, we just played along
Always putting up a show
But that was then, look at us now
All we want is for them to know

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jessika]
We are who we are
And who we are is who we wanna be
We don't have to listen
'Cause all that counts is you and me

[Chorus 1: Jessika]
And then we’ll be rising where we fall, oh, oh
In the middle of storm we're standing tall, oh, standing tall

Don't get sad, don't be bitter, don't give up or be a quitter
Show them you're better (yeah, hell no)
If they say so, get in the car, rev it up, and be it a star

Higher Ground,"[Verse 1]
Ships in the making
Bound for a distant shore
World for the taking
Men gone forever more
Boarding and setting sail
Yet, victory won't prevail

Freeze the arrow in the air
Make your mark and leave it hanging there
Be the first to turn around
Take the leap to land on higher ground

No longer in the dark
My castle in the sand

The memory and you
The things I've been through
And everything I do
We start believing by the minute
Now that I'm in it

Are soaring through the sky, oh
I've flown with kings and queens
With freedom in their eyes

My Lucky Day,"[Verse 1]
You got secrets to unfold
You got stories never told
You’re holding information
Standing right in front of me
A hidden rhapsody
I walk into temptation

Something tells me we can make some music
The rhythm is drivin’ me wild
And something tells me we ain’t gonna loose it

Will you stay or walk away

Outlaw in 'Em,"[Verse 1]
It's a fine, fine line
Between whiskey, and water, into wine
It's a long way home
When you're down and out and out here on your own
But it don't matter who you are when it's time to lock and load

[Chorus 1]
Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
Chrome piece hidin' in their blacked out denim
Heartbeat beatin' to a rock 'n' roll rhythm, yeah
Everybody's got a couple scarred up knuckles
Blood on their boots and their back-off buckle
Diamondback rattle with a quick strike venom
Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
(Hmm)

[Verse 2]
When they knock you to the ground
You ain't gonna let nobody keep you down
When your back's against the wall
That's when you gotta learn to stand up tall
Yeah, that rebel fight inside of you
Has been there all along

Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em
Chrome piece hidin' in their blacked out denim
Heartbeat beatin' to a rock 'n' roll rhythm, yeah

Blood on their boots and their back-off buckle
Diamondback rattle with a quick strike venom
Everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em

Chrome piece hidin' in their blacked out denim
Heartbeat beatin' to a rock 'n' roll rhythm, yeah

A new tattoo that you can't keep hidden

We Got Love,"[Verse 1]
Why do we always feel like we need to try?
Why do we believe that we need to be somebody else
To feel alive?
Why do we make
Why do we keep making the same mistakes?
And believing that it won't make a difference if we try
To break away

[Chorus]
I know, I know what you must be thinking
That we are powerless to change things
But don't, don't give up
'Cause we got love, 'cause we got love
I won't throw my hands up to surrender
'Cause love is stronger than fire
So don't, don't give up
'Cause we got love, 'cause we got love

[Verse 2]
Time, don't you think it's just a waste of time?
When we're always fighting over material trivial things
In this life, yeah
I don't understand why we don't get it right
Why do we keep going round and round?
At the end of the day, we've only got ourselves to blame

[Chorus]
I know, I know what you must be thinking
That we are powerless to change things
But don't, don't give up
'Cause we got love, 'cause we got love

So don't, don't give up
'Cause we got love, 'cause we got love

For You (Sheni gulistvis) (შენი გულისთვის),"Day - be longer
And melt the snow
To warm up the one, who felt cold in the night
Shine not for me
For us
For us
Make the heart feel joyful for the others' happiness The sun rises in time
To grant People warmness
And the earth keeps turning with love Let understand the feelings of others share with others
What is the heart if not break into nine pieces to with others
The wind will carry the rest away
You own only what you share Day breaks the night
If I am by your side
Something ends and there Comes a new start
Kindness will live forever on the earth For you
For love
For just one Flash
We go on our way
All is yours what you share"

In foreign eyes
And I know, and I know, and I know that you hear my cry
Tears tell no lie

Let our guards down, it's time to break the taboo
Before we all become animals, animals
Echos in my head, got to break the taboo

But sticks and stones won't break my soul
Gotta be your own miracle, miracle
It's in my bones, got to break the taboo
Before we all become animals, animals

I know that I am not alone
Let all our thoughts and ghosts unfold
In the darkness I've found home
But what is next is still unknown
And I know, and I know, and I know that you hear my cry
Tears tell no lie

Let our guards down, it's time to break the taboo
Before we all become animals, animals
Echos in my head, got to break the taboo

Viszlát nyár,"Let's be cruelly honest1 :
my boat has to go
and it will leave you here. My blood will live within you
and if you don't sell it, the mark is on your heart,
which lifts you up from the ground to the sky. Goodbye summer, you missed me,
'cause you lied that you'll be mine
but you didn't come! Goodbye dream, I'm so thankful that you're gone!
Now it's time to give me back
what you took away from me! The life has got tired in my veins,
I know that you'd hold (me)
but please, let me go. Here it is, strip your part out of me
and if you don't sell it, the mark is on your heart,
which lifts you up from the ground to the sky."

Inje (Иње),"Hoarfrost fell on us
it's freezing the blood in my veins
and you, oh, heart, are shrinking
and forgetting fast Love is shaking like a leaf
in the middle of summer, I stand frozen
I'm shaking too, my voice is shaking
ever since I lost us The duvet is warming my body in vain
because the draught is flowing through my soul I'm living pointlessly
losing even when I'm winning
but when no one sees
I let you come visit my heart I'm living just to pass by
like a slave in a solitary confinement
but when no one hears
I let my heart rejoice Me and my life are like a dog and a cat
my heart is its most expensive toy I'm living pointlessly
losing even when I'm winning

I let you come visit my heart I'm living just to pass by

PERFECTION. I am fighting with a smile to the Sun I am fighting for the people
The way to the truth blinds me
The first love comes to make me blurred
I take what a body makes free. Don't believe in everything what is offered to you

Real masterpiece, priceless
Each response is in me I find it when I fall asleep
When the body is relaxed ready for eveything Don't believe in everything What is offered to you

Thanks, thanks, no Like a marionette for the people
hiding over masks
Equal, perfect, but not satisfied
Thanks, no, no, no -ooo Don't believe in everything what is offered to you
think with loud voice and hope
That secret is not to sell yourself to everybody
it is the most out of fashion
Thanks, no, no!
No, thanks
No, thanks, no
Thanks, thanks, no
no, no,no,no!"
Under the Ladder,"[Verse 1]
Curtains down, I’m laughing at the trial
Help me to unravel
Tangle of my innocence inside
Faith’s bout to be severed

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh oh oh oh, won’t get any better
Oh oh oh oh, walk under the ladder
Shout out just one reason what’s this for

[Chorus]
You can see that whatever the weather
That the wind’s always there, always fair, oh oh oh
And it has always been now or never
The decision has got to be made, oh oh oh
(Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, yeah)
(Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Desperate thoughts, your hope calls you a liar
Fear begins to revel
Nothing but your will sets you on fire
Fire lasts forever

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh oh oh oh, can’t get any better
Oh oh oh oh, dance under the ladder
If you dare, so what you’re waiting for

[Chorus]
You can see that whatever the weather
That the wind’s always there, always fair, oh oh oh
And it has always been now or never
The decision has got to be made, oh oh oh
(Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, yeah)
(Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, yeah)

[Bridge]
You can see that whatever the weather
That the wind’s always there, always fair, oh oh oh
And it has always been now or never
The decision has got to be made

[Chorus]
You can see that whatever the weather
That the wind’s always there, always fair, oh oh oh
And it has always been now or never
The decision has got to be made

You can see that whatever the weather
That the wind’s always there, always fair, oh oh oh
And it has always been now or never
The decision has got to be made, oh oh oh
(Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, yeah)
(Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, yeah)"
Tu canción,"What are you doing in your days
I look at you in the photos
But I don’t give it my heart I don’t want to talk to you
To not return to what was before
I don’t want to talk to you
But I am craving to see you I write your name on my hand
I write your name on my hand Walking into the woods
Full of ashes
I look at you in the eyes
But I don’t give it my heart I want to kiss you
But nothing shines
The storm is approaching
Don’t get scared, don’t get scared I write your name on my hand
I write your name on my hand
I write your name with fire
I write your name on my hand Under the flash
I’m going to tell you my secrets"
O jardim,"I never wanted you
Less than anything
Always, my love If you're also happy in the sky
Take me, I'll take care
Always, around me The flowers are my place
Now that you're not here
I water your garden The flowers are my place
Now that you're not here
I water your garden I already promissed
That someday I'll change
Or try to be bigger If you're also happy in the sky
Take me, I swear
Always, for your value The flowers are my place
Now that you're not here
I water your garden The flowers are my place
Now that you're not here
I water your garden Now that you're not here, I water your garden
Now that you're not here, I water your garden
Now that you're not here
Now that you're not here, I water your garden"
Storm,"[Verse 1]
Hey, hey brother
Do you remember when we were kids with no fear?
Hey, hey sister
Do you believe in the things we dreamt we'd discover?

[Pre-Chorus]
I still have faith
I still believe in chasing rainbows

Storms don't last forever, forever, remember
We can hold our hands together

You Let Me Walk Alone,"[Verse 1]
I'm a dreamer, a make believer
I was told that you were too
I love the silence and the clear horizon
And I got that all from you

[Pre-Chorus]
Every now and then I'm drawn to places
Where I hear your voice or see your face, and
Every little thought will lead me right back to you

[Chorus]
I was born from one love of two hearts
We were three kids and a loving mum
You made this place a home
A shelter from the storm
You said I had one life and a true heart
I tried my best and I came so far
But you will never know
'Cause you let me walk this road alone

[Verse 2]
My childhood hero will always be you
And no one else comes close
I thought you'd lead me when life's misleading
That's when I miss you most

[Pre-Chorus]
Every now and then I'm drawn to places
Where I hear your voice or see your face, and
Every little thought will lead me right back to you

[Chorus]
I was born from one love of two hearts
We were three kids and a loving mum
You made this place a home
A shelter from the storm
You said I had one life and a true heart
I tried my best and I came so far
But you will never know
'Cause you let me walk this road alone

[Bridge]
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh

[Chorus]
I was born from one love of two hearts
We were three kids and a loving mum
You made this place a home
A shelter from the storm
You said I had one life and a true heart
I tried my best and I came so far
But you will never know
'Cause you let me walk this road alone"
Mercy,"I was born this morning
My name is Mercy
Far out at sea
Between two countries, Mercy It was a long path and Mum walked it
She had me in her skin, eight and a half months
Oh yes, eight and a half months We left home, it was at war
Sure she had it right, there was nothing to lose
Oh no, apart from life I was born this morning
My name is Mercy
They lent me a hand
And I am alive
I am all of those children
Whom the sea took away
I'll live one hundred thousand years
My name is Mercy And there, before our eyes, was the enemy
A blue immensity, perhaps infinite
But yes, we knew the price of it Arising from a wave, a friendly ship
Gave its chance back to our survival
And it's here that I let out my first cry I was born this morning
My name is Mercy
They lent me a hand
And I am alive
I am all of those children
Whom the sea took away
I'll live one hundred thousand years
My name is Mercy I was born this morning
My name is Mercy Thanks, thanks, I'm alright thanks
Thanks, thanks, I'm alright thanks
Thanks, thanks, I'm alright thanks
Thanks, thanks, I'm alright thanks"
Non mi avete fatto niente,"In Cairo people don't know what time is it now
Today the sun over the Rambla is not the same
There's a concert in France, people are having fun
Someone's singing loudly, someone's screaming ""to death"" It always rains in London, but today it's fine
The sky doesn't make concessions, not even at a funeral
In Nice the sea is red for fires and shame
With people on the concrete and blood in the sewer And this enormous body that we call earth
Wounded in its organs from Asia to England
A galaxy of people lost in space
But the most important one is the space for an hug From childless mothers, from children without a father
From faces enlightened like walls without paintings
Minutes full of silence, broken by a voice
""You did nothing to me"" You did nothing to me
You took nothing from me
This is my life that goes on
Beyond everything, beyond the people You did nothing to me
You gained nothing
Because everything goes beyond
Your useless wars There are people that cross themselves, people that pray on carpets
Churches and Mosques. Imams and all the priests
Separated entries in the same house
Billions of people that hope for something Handless arms, nameless faces
Let's change our skin we are humans deep down
'cause our lives are not a point of view
And it doesn't exist a pacifist bomb You did nothing to me
You took nothing from me
This is my life that goes on
Beyond everything, beyond the people You did nothing to me
You gained nothing
Because everything goes beyond
Your useless wars
Your useless wars Skyscrapers and subways will fall apart
Walls raised for money
But against all kind of terror that inder the path
The world gets up on his feet with a child smile
With a child smile You did nothing to me
You gained nothing
Because everything goes beyond
Your useless wars You did nothing to me
Your useless wars
You took nothing from me
Your useless wars
You did nothing to me
Your useless wars
You gained nothing
Your useless wars I am aware that nothing will come back
Happiness flew
As a bubble flies away"

Heaven,"[Verse 1]
Life, life was once so lonely
Heartbreak was the only thing you left for me
My life, my life was so empty
And love was the furthest, furthest thing from me

[Chorus]
Falling, I'm in Heaven, falling
I'm in Heaven, falling, straight into your heart

Walking blind with hanging heart (With hanging heart)
I was ready to give up
Now you came into my life

Falling

I'll catch you while you're falling

Look Away,"[Verse 1]
There's something you should know
I can't sing a love song anymore
There's something going on
And I can't turn my back on it anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
How can we go to sleep at night
And lay there in our beds?
When we know what's going on
With the world today

[Chorus]
Is it in my head?
Am I the only one?
Is it in my head?
Where the war has just begun?

[Drop]
We look away, look away, look away, look away, hey
Look away, look away, look away, look away
Is it in my head?
Is it in my head?
Look away, look away, hey, no

[Verse 2]
There's something in the air at night
That feels so different
And I don't understand
I didn't see this one coming

[Pre-Chorus]
How can we go to sleep at night
And lay there in our beds?
When we know what's going on
With the world today

[Chorus]
Is it in my head?
Am I the only one?
Is it in my head?
Where the war has just begun?

Fire of Love (Pali się),"Fire! Fire! Fire of love! Sitting on an iceberg
Waiting for the sun
Hoping to be rescued
Cold and alone
One small spark becomes a flame
By the floating wind of the spring fields It is burning! It is burning
A fire of love
It is burning inside us! It is burning inside us
Like a dry forest
Love me! Love me!
More and more
It will not help! It will not help!
The fire brigade A lonely heart
That is only in doubt
As it has never been hugged
Is frozen in ice
A ray of promise
Can melt this ice
It will be set free
By the voice of love It is burning! It is burning
A fire of love
It is burning inside us! It is burning inside us
Like a dry forest
Love me! Love me!
More and more
It will not help! It will not help!
The fire brigade An excited heart
That does not feel anything
Is indifferent to the world
Hard as a stone
But when it is in a hurry
It will unchain itself
It will make the eyes sprakle
During the time on the road It is burning! It is burning
A fire of love
It is burning inside us! It is burning inside us
Like a dry forest
Love me! Love me!
More and more
It will not help! It will not help!
The fire brigade Fire! Fire! Fire of love!
Burns in you, burns in me
Burns us alive
Love me now! Love me now!
Harder and harder
Take me there, be the air I need to survive"
Sebi,"When your mind is full
You can listen to my heart beating
When your burden is heavy
You can take refuge in me Ask me what keeps me going
It's achievements and distances
When a leaf goes with the wind and resists it
I go with the flow and resist it The stars are not always visible
Stay true to yourself
Don't tell me to forgive you 1 There are tears in your eyes
Let them keep falling
When our wishes differ
You accept me and I accept you Look at me...
... that everything has a meaning 2 Eternity and this planet are not friends
I, as well, am but a snowflake that's waiting for spring to come The stars are not always visible
Stay true to yourself
Don't tell me to forgive you You needn't prove yourself
The same tears and the same fear bind us The stars are not always visible
Stay true to yourself
Don't tell me to forgive you"
Friend of a Friend,"[Verse 1]
Can you hear it?
There's someone behind the wall making the same sounds
Can you hear it?
It sounds like you and me when we’re making love
Who is it?
You said you wish they weren't taking such a long time

[Pre-Chorus]
She was my neighbour when we were thirteen
She moved back in
There's not much between us now
Do you know what I mean?

She’s only a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend
She's never home 'cause she plays in a band

Az én apám,"My father raised me like the wind
Blowing softly, singing, telling fairy tales
He lived where every road ended
One thousand and one years aren’t enough for a life, for a life I can hear him, his heart on the strings
I can see him, bearing the passing time on my face
I’m proud to confess his faith
Of a thousand and one songs this is the one that I hum Old days, beautiful days
I love his memory
He calls me and I run to him
That was a lovely way to play Old songs summon him
I still feel the sun's light
I can still hear the drone of the wind
I can still hear him in the voice of the wind With a song he drove my sadness far away
All I can give him is that I belong to him
And I can say to my son with pride
He's my father, and here's my home Old days, beautiful days
I love his memory
He calls me and I run to him
That was a lovely way to play Old songs summon him
I still feel the sun's light
The wind whistled a lullaby so my dream would be beautiful
The wind whistled a lullaby, I can still hear it today"

Europe will crumble
A web of lies
Will arise from the ashes
United as one All that I saw
Tears ran down
All that I gave
Once gave
I gave it all to you All that I saw
Tears ran down
All that I gave
Once gave
I gave it all to you Hate will prevail
Love will die
Hate will prevail
Happiness comes to an end
For it is an illusion
A treacherous pipe dream Hate will prevail"
Storm,"[Verse 1]
All my life I've wondered why
I keep fighting all the tides
For a million reasons that I find
But I might, I might be all wrong
I’ve hit highs and I've hit lows
But somewhere down the winding road
It felt like I could lose it all
But I might, I might have been wrong

[Chorus]
A storm like this
Can break a man like this
But when it all calms down
We're still safe and sound

[Verse 2]
All my life I’ve tried to find
The meaning of what's left behind
They say it's life itself
But I feel it might, it might be all wrong

[Chorus]
A storm like this
Can break a man like this
And when it all calms down
We're still safe and sound
A storm like this
Can break a man like this
And when it all calms down
We'll be safe and sound

[Post-Chorus]
Even if the sky falls down
We can turn it all around
We'll escape the darkest clouds
Then we'll be safe and sound

[Bridge]
Wherever we may go
Whatever happens down the road
However far from home
I know we won't let go

[Chorus]
A storm like this
Can break a man like this
And when it all calms down
We’ll be safe and sound

[Post-Chorus]
Even if the sky falls down
We can turn it all around
We’ll escape the darkest clouds
Then we'll be safe and sound

[Chorus]
A storm like this
Can break a man like this
And when it all calms down
We’ll be safe and sound

[Outro]
In no time the storm will end
And it'll be alright again
The battle scars won't matter then
But I might, I might be all wrong"
Telemóveis,"I broke my phone
Trying to call up to heaven
To find out if I kill off my saudade1
Or if I'm the one who dies
Who kills whom?
Who kills whom?
Will it kill?
Who kills whom?
Not even I know
When I find out
I won't call another soul If life calls you up
If life sends you a message
If it doesn't stop
And you don't have the courage to pick up
You already know what'll come next
I'll go downstairs
And I'll wreck my phone, the ol' celly
I'll break the phone
Both yours and mine
And I'll wreck my phone
I want to live and obliterate my phone And what if I break my phone?
I'll only have broken what belonged to me
I have yet to see if my saudade will die
It turns out I'm the one who dies
Who kills whom?
Will it kill?
I don't even know The sensationalists have never seen anyone be born
I used to break phones
But I never break mine anymore
I know that my saudade is dead
The one who shot the arrow was me
The one who shot the arrow was me
It was me"
Better Love,"[Verse 1]
Live for the mess, make me feel ageless
No pain, no gain
Teach me carelessness
And I'm about to see all that's made up
And everything they want from us
No pain, no gain
Once bitten, make way

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't hide it
I won't fight this yearning feeling inside

[Chorus]
Gotta get better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love (Who)
Better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love (Who)

There's nothing more to say to back it up when I'm unafraid
I've lost enough
Go on, hold on for dear life

'Cause I won't hide it
I can't fight this burning feeling inside

Gotta get better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love (Who)

Walking Out,"[Verse 1]
Who are you? What you really do
When you have to fight the agony that's aiming back at you?
Who are you? Who you run to?
Depend, defend, hope on
Can you function on your own?

Are you from those who will swallow down
The pain, disgrace, the sadness? Yeah
When the one you love so much
Can take your soul and break it, no

Wait for, oh, wait for
What I waited for
Wait for, oh, wait for
Oh, no, I'm done

[Chorus]
Walking out, uh
Whatever I've built I'm gonna burn down
I'm walking out, uh
You're no more a king 'cause I was your crown

[Verse 2]
First, you said you would die for me
But in the end, I was the one bleeding all alone
First, you said, you kneeled, you swore
You loved, you lived for me
How could you forget it all?

[Refrain 2]
Are you from those who can take a loving heart
And squeeze it out of love?
Then prepare to slowly get not loved but hated instead

Walking out, uh
Whatever I've built I'm gonna burn down
I'm walking out, uh
You're no more a king 'cause I was your crown

I see 22, oh, when I think of you
Lately, that's all I do
Don't you know that I, I'm always driving by
Wanna come home to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I know I've always been afraid to say
How I feel, but this's got to change

Stay,"[Verse 1]
Hold on, even with the wind we'll make it
Be strong, keep the fire burning inside
Go on, as I breathe in you
Look into my eyes
Fly me high, right up to the sky

Stay, until I find a way to be together
Forever's here to stay
No matter what they say
It’s now or never, it's forever

This time, we can try to keep our story
This crime, we can stop from breaking apart
No rhyme is a match for you
Never let me down
If I fall I'm nothing at all

Forever's here to stay
No matter what they say
It’s now or never, it's forever

That Night,"[Verse 1]
It was a lonely night
No stars were shining, there was no light
One troubled thought broke through
And colored my world so blue

[Chorus]
Lo-o-o-o-ove, where are you?
Lo-o-o-o-ove, I need you
Lo-o-o-o-ove, all night through
Where are you, my love? Oh

[Verse 2]
I travelled through the time
It felt for me like doing a crime
My mind did crazy things
Imagination opened their wings

[Verse 3]
A river dark as coal
It took me far away from the shore
Please come to me 'till sunrise
And take me back to my paradise

[Chorus]
Lo-o-o-o-ove, where are you?
Lo-o-o-o-ove, I need you
Lo-o-o-o-ove, all night through
Where are you, my love? Oh

On a Sunday,"[Verse 1]
You left me on a Sunday
And I still remember that day in September
Yeah, you left me on a Sunday
Made sure there’s no way, yeah, to forget that day

[Chorus]
Say yeah-ey-ey, ey, ey, ey, ey
Loving you is a hard price to pay
Ey, ey, ey, ey

[Verse 2]
Watching the smoke rise from the ashtray
Filling the room with pain
It's still in my veins
Can't feel at home, 'cause it's so lonely
So cold and so grey, yeah, since you left that day
You know, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
Even if the sun rises and the world moves on every day, ey, ey, ey
I will always be waiting for you to come back home to me
To me, to me, ey, ey

Is this even true?
Am I without you?
Love's not fair
Oh, I have learned that
Just never knew that I'll be losing you
You know, you know

Even if the sun rises and the world moves on every day, ey
I will always be waiting for you to come back home to me

Love Is Forever,"[Verse 1]
Travel the world to see
The ruins of what has been
Learning our history
But still, we don't take it in

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Why we make it tough? The world has had enough
Don't get too political
And who are we to judge? It doesn't take too much
Only just a miracle

[Chorus 1]
Love is forever
Love is forever and everyone
Love is forever
Love is forever and everyone
Just a taste of love, a taste of what
Could actually rule both me and you
A taste of love is all we got
So don't you never ever give up love

[Verse 2]
Come over my long lost friend
And work on a happy end
Imagine what we could do
After what we've been through

Why we make it tough? The world has had enough
Don't get too political
And who are we to judge? It doesn't take too much
Only just a miracle

Love is forever
Love is forever and everyone
Just a taste of love, a taste of what

Venez découvrir la vie
Ce soir on va tous partir
Le beau temps n'est pas fini
Qu'en dîtes-vous, mon ami ?

Hvorfor ska' vi slås? All we need is love
Liebe ist für alle da
Kærlighed er håb, alle ka' forstå

A taste of love is all we got
So don't you never ever give up love"
Too Late for Love,"[Verse 1]
Hey, how you been?
I wonder, do you ever think of me?
Say, am I wrong
To wonder if it could be you and me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too late for love? Hmm
Is it too late for love? I wanna know
Is it too late for love? I can't take no more
Is it?

[Chorus]
I could be the sun that lights your dark
Maybe I would lit your world with just one spark
I could make it burn for you and me
If I could be there, I would be there
Hear me
I could be the sun that lights your dark
(Is it too late for love? Is it too late for love?)
Hear me
I could make it burn for you and me

[Verse 2]
Days came and went
But nothing ever really felt the same
You left a space
Where everything reminds me of your face

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too late for love? Hmm
Is it too late for love? I wanna know

[Chorus]
I could be the sun that lights your dark
Maybe I would lit your world with just one spark
I could make it burn for you and me
If I could be there, I would be there
Hear me
I could be the sun that lights your dark
(Is it too late for love? Is it too late for love?)
Hear me
I could make it burn for you and me
(Is it too late for love? Is it too late for love?)

[Bridge]
We could be a storm that rages on
And maybe we would own the ocean carry on

[Chorus]
I could be the sun that lights your dark
Maybe I would lit your world with just one spark
I could make it burn for you and me
If I could be there, I would be there
Hear me
I could be the sun that lights your dark
(Is it too late for love? Is it too late for love?) Is it too late for love?
But is it too late for love?
Is it?"
Limits,"[Verse 1]
Mind's got to move, but I'm so trapped within me
Expanded all my limits too carelessly
And I'm counting on the time to get me back in line
'Cause nothing really makes sense no more
But I'm set on hold, so I needn't be bold anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the face in the mirror
Just couldn't look clearer right back through me
And how I'd like to say
It will be better tomorrow or any day

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, you
You and the luck you try to find
You, you
You and how hard you try to hide it

[Verse 2]
I sense the pain, but it doesn't hurt anymore
It's even number than the ache I felt before
So I smile for a while, let the torture begin and
The pressure on my chest becomes almost routine, oh
It's not like I don't care, but there's nothing left to bare

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, you
You and the love you try to find
You, you
You and how hard you try to hide it

[Bridge]
And I'm letting it all come crashing down
Come breaking in
It's like the rain just left black blurred outlines

[Chorus]
And I'm talking 'bout you, you
You and the love you try to find
You, you
You and how hard you try to hide it"
The Dream (Heroj),"I have a dream
A dream as beautiful as it is extreme
I know it's not as crazy as it may seem
So I don't ever wanna give up on this dream
Open your heart
And you'll arrive at where the dream has to start
To pull a world together out of the parts
And turn this war into a hopeful work of art
We have lived the darkest night
Waiting for the day
Now the time for us is right
To arise and say
I dream of love
You dream of love
Angels of God
We all dream of love
I dream of love
You dream of love
Angels of God
We all dream of love
To the world you don't owe
Anything (to bring)
You are only human when
You're able to love
Like a hero
Like a hero
Both yours and mine
Love is a hero
Like a hero
Like a hero
Both yours and mine
Love is a hero"

Scream,"[Verse 1]
No, I can't stay here longer
You cannot make me cry
So, I will leave you to wonder
What will become of our lives

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ll swallow hard, fall apart
Break and bleed but you won't see

Tears won't fall
While pride stands tall
Maybe they can’t be heard or seen
But tears aren't quiet things
They scream, they scream, oh
They scream, oh

Though my throat is on fire
My eyes will be liars
And they'll try to stay drier
Until you turn away

I'll swallow hard, fall apart
Break and bleed but you won't see

[Chorus]
Tears will fall, I hear them all
They scream (Scream, they scream)
They scream, oh

[Bridge]
Not so silent and innocent
Acid rain from your fingerprints
Echoes, rivers of loneliness
Hitting the walls of my heart

[Chorus]
They scream, oh (Not so silent and innocent, acid rain from your fingerprints)
They scream, oh (Echoes, rivers of loneliness, hitting the walls of my heart)"
Ktheju tokës,"You sing and cry,
In hands, tears are gathered
You held them, One day you live
The next you die
How much nostalgy, how little hope
Alone, no identity Return to your Land
Oh man that held hostage the heart
Return to your Land
You know there is a heart waiting for you One day you live
The next you die
How much nostalgy, how little hope
Alone, no identity Return to your Land
Oh man that held hostage the heart
Return to your Land
You know there is a heart waiting for you"
Spirit in the Sky,"[Verse 1: Tom Hugo]
Can't you stay, stay with me into the night?
Stay, I need you close
You can go back when the sun rise again
Just stay tonight, just stay

[Verse 2: Alexandra Rotan]
Have you seen my spirit, lost in the night?
The violent nightshade, they took away my light
They call us nothing, my name is nothing
Come see me, please see me

[Pre-Chorus 1: Alexandra Rotan]
'Cause I've been running with the demons now
They all see my fear
They say there's nothing, nothing here

I see your spirit in the sky
When northern lights are dancing
He-lo e loi-la
I hear you calling me at night
Whenever wind is blowing
He-lo e loi-la
I can see your spirit in the sky
When northern lights are dancing
He-lo e loi-la

[Verse 3: Tom Hugo]
I'll follow you until the daylight
Shy us away

[Verse 4: Alexandra Rotan]
I need a hero, I need my light
Her shining lightwaves will break away the night
I call it freedom, our name is freedom
Come find me, please find me

[Pre-Chorus 2: Alexandra Rotan]
'Cause I am dancing with the fairies now
They all sing our name
I got my light here, shining here

[Chorus: Tom Hugo, Alexandra Rotan, Fred Buljo]
I hear you calling me at night
Whenever wind is blowing

Arcade,"[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

[Pre-Chorus]
I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

[Verse 2]
How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

I don't need your games, game over
Get me off this rollercoaster

Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

Girl, they will try to tell you what to do
How to look, smile, act and move
All the rules are made for you to lose
But baby let me tell you something

[Verse 2]
Girl, for every tear the world makes you cry
Hold on to me
I am always on your side
Don't be afraid to spread your wings and fly

[Chorus]
Tell them
Raise your voice and say it loudly
Show them what it means to stand up proudly
Tell them
This is me and thanks to you I'm proud
Go on now, tell them
Raise your voice and say it loudly
Show them what it means to stand up proudly
Tell them
This is me and thanks to you I'm proud, I'm proud, I'm proud

Girl, they will try to tell you what to do
Have no fear, the power lies in you
Shine your light, go and break the rules

Go on now, tell them
Raise your voice and say it loudly
Show them what it means to stand up proudly
Tell them
This is me and thanks to you I'm proud, I'm proud, I'm proud

Truth,"[Verse 1]
I'm in the mirror, so freaking bitter
But I’ve gotta get through
I'm gonna get through
Keep it together, be cool under pressure
'Cause she wants to break you
She wants to break you

[Pre-Chorus]
Drink till I forget
She’s on to the next
And when the ghost starts screaming
Right when they resonate
Hear my heart confess

[Chorus]
It's been so hard to bear
So shut up about it
Shut up about it
It's just too hard to hear
So shut up about it
Shut up about it

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Shut up, shut up about it

[Verse 2]
Out of the mirror, it's getting clearer
But then out of the blue she crashes the room
Gotta remember, she is a killer
With that freaking perfume
Girl, it's too soon

[Chorus]
It's been so hard to bear
So shut up about it
Shut up about it
It's just too hard to hear
So shut up about it
Shut up about it

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Shut up, shut up about it
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Shut up, shut up about it

I don't need, I don’t need the truth
I don’t need, I don't need the truth

[Chorus]
It’s been so hard to bear
So shut up about it
Shut up about it
It's just too hard to hear
So shut up about it
Shut up about it

I tried to stop your fire
Turns out that I couldn’t
I'm tired, tired of competing
I tried to hold you under
But honey, you kept breathing

[Pre-Chorus: Carlotta Truman & Laurita Kästel]
When you said you wanted the world
I said you couldn't too
You were walking right beside me

Calling you my enemy, but my enemy’s right here
It was my mistake to try and break
That power that I feared

[Verse 1]
Caught up in this moment 'til my heartbeat stops
I've been running barefoot to the mountain tops
Nothing comes as easy as it goes
I can hug the water when it snows

[Chorus]
I feel the sun upon my skin
And I am someone, I am someone
You pulled my heart, I took it in
It made me someone, I am someone
And now I'm done, I'm coming home

I used to listen to the way they talk
Counting down the minutes from the ticking clock

[Chorus]
I feel the sun upon my skin
And I am someone, I am someone
You pulled my heart, I took it in
It made me someone, I am someone
And now I'm done, I'm coming

Home was so far, collecting scars, I refuse
Another touch won't be another bruise

I feel the sun upon my skin
And I am someone, I am someone

Roi,"I am me
And I know I will always be
I am free
Sure I am inventing my life
Don't ask me who I am I am
The same since I was very little
And in spite of looks, opinions
I cry, I go out and I laugh You put me in a box
Want me to be like you
I don't follow the codes
People are disturbed a lot
At the end of the day
You canno change me, boo !

You try to take me down
You cannot break me nah nah

Do like this, do like that
I don't look right through them
You'll never remove my crown Who are we ?
When we hide, when we fight for free
Only god can judge you and me
We did not choose what we are We choose
Our work, our hairstyle, our friends
Our routine
Sometimes love too
It's make or break but it's none of your business I'm not rich but i'm shining bright

On tv they are airing Jackie Chan
He's smoking Shisha and asks me how I'm doing He asks me how I'm doing doing doing
You alredy know how things are going going going
I think faster to try to figure out if you're going to fool me tomorrow
I have no time to clear things up 'cause I finally found out what you are
It hurts to be alive
When you lose your pride
You leave home out of the blue You, tell me if
You only cared for the money money
As if you had any money
Tell me whether you miss me or you don't give a fuck You used to ask me how I was doing doing doing
Now how are things going going going
What you're supposed to say you haven't said yet
Betrayal is a bullet in your chest Keep all the compassion to yourself
You keep lyin' at home but you know she knows
Sittin' there she'll be asking me Asking me how I'm doing doing doing
She already knows how things are going going going
I think faster to try to figure out if you're going to fool me tomorrow
I have no time to clear things up 'cause I finally found out what you are

Back then you would talk to me till late You used to ask me how I'm doing doing doing
Now how are things going going going

You used to tell me while playing your games with pride
My son, my son, darling, [Arabic] It felt so real to me
Wanting to bring things back to what they were I didn't ask you for your money...

Fall From The Sky,"Words have cut me to the bone
And my heart is sinking like a stone
But I don’t let it show
Barely take another breath
Though I’m suffocating here alone
I’ll never let you know
Fall from the sky
Always making me hold back my wings
When I’m destined to fly
I’m screaming inside
You can crush and break down my walls
But my heart will survive
You have made me doubt my faith
Hide the truth behind another lie
But you won’t see me cry
I pray for you for all you’ve done
All the hurt that you leave in your wake It’s so hard not to break
You think I’m better without
A way to speak my mind
You think I don’t wanna shout
And that I’m terrified
Screaming inside
With nowhere to hide
You won’t let me flyyyyyyy..
Fall from the sky
As you hold back my wings
When I’m destined to fly
I’m screaming inside
Fall...
Fall from the sky
Break down my walls
But I’m destined to fly"

Da Vidna,"I braided the autumn and then untwisted it.
I got lost, just like winter covers the late paths with snow.
I asked myself: do I need the one that I had not chosen?
Oh, I was confused until dawn, in the dark night full of secrets and passion...
Until dawn, until dawn I didn't stay alone.
Until dawn, until dawn the clear moon united us.
Until dawn, until dawn the clear moon united us.
Until dawn, until dawn I didn't stay alone...
I wasn't the one to blame for staying not alone.
Oh, my youth just passed me by.
Oh how early, oh so early, my white rose, to whom did you bloom?
Oh mom, do I need the one that I had not chosen?
Oh, I was confused until dawn, in the dark night full of secrets and passion...
Until dawn, until dawn I didn't stay alone.

and each time I'm getting colder,
pain, I should let it go
Your lies burn like sugar in my wounds
In time my wound will be a scar
Strained but my tears are getting sober now
and I've been here before so,
weight that I'm holding on my shoulders,
I'm gonna let it go
This is my first time trying
Look how the tables turn
I've got this dirt inside me
I've got some space to grow
Your lies burn like sugar in my wounds
So I have sweet bruises
In time I'll forget what you have done
In time my wound will be a scar
My pain will soon be over
Oh, how the tables turn
Tears are getting sober
I got some space to grow
Your lies burn like sugar in my wounds
So I have sweet bruises
In time I'll forget what you have done
In time my wound will be a scar"
Divlji Vjetre,"Once when you forget my name
and the bed becomes cold
like winters bound in snow,
when nothing remains
I will love you still,
wild wind.
In silence, leave me where I am
Every word is now hollow.
Leave and don't let me know
how a person becomes what they're not anymore.
Wild wind,
here on my doorstep bring me the withered leaves
and let the trace of sadness
leave rain in the colours of the fall.
And it seemed like we were forever intertwined
with our soul and body.
All I am left with is sadness in the colours of the fall.
(What you're not anymore)
Cold like frozen rain
when you stop loving.
Ripping the branches uncontrollably,
but before you disappear
Wild wind,
here on my doorstep bring me the withered leaves
and let the trace of sadness
leave rain in the colours of the fall.
And it seemed like we were forever intertwined
with our soul and body.
All I am left with is sadness in the colours of the fall.
Sadness in the colours of the fall,
sadness in the colours of the fall.
Wild wind,
here on my doorstep bring me the withered leaves
and let the trace of sadness
leave rain in the colours of the fall.
And it seemed like we were forever intertwined
with our soul and body.
All I am left with is sadness in the colours of the fall."
Running,"I don't feel like talking, let me sit here alone.
The phone's ca-alling, I can't pick it up
I'm tired of running from these demons (demons)
I'm tired of running from these demons, I can't see any more
I can't see anymore
But I keep on running, I keep on running
I keep on running away
Now I keep on running, I keep on running
I don't wanna fall again
Drowning out my memories, from the night before
Door's kno-o-cking, just leave me alone
Looking - losing
My energy - tripping
Anybody tow me back home
(Yeah yeah)
Standing naked
Putting on fake smiles
I don´t wanna be sad anymore
I don't wanna fall again
I'm not gonna fall again"
Kemama,"Ay, Benny Cristo and Glowsticks

Haha
Kemama, you know

See, I don't care if you are not like me
I just came to dance
We should dance all night, babe, night, babe
And I don't care if they don't like me
All I do is dance, I don't care about their fighting
Why they fighting
Kemama, you know
They can say what they want, you should let it go, ey
'Cause tonight I will sho-o-ow love
I'll show them I can dance on my own

YES,"I was 6 feet under for the one and only
Spend the nights feeling bitter sad and lonely
Didn't realize how much fear controlled me
Until you came and loved me like I'm holy
Now I'm ready to give life one more chance
Hey

I have got an arrow through my chest
I am so in love I must confess
Say Yes Say Yes Say Yes

I have got an arrow through my chest
I am so in love I must confess
Say Yes Say Yes
Uhhh
Never thought I would be high on life but sober
Didn't think I would be able to turn this over
Let's make stories to talk about when we are older
Come and rest your pretty head upon my shoulder
Now I'm ready to give life one more chance

What Love Is,"How mysterious this life can be
Full of beautiful surprises
I never really knew the man I thought was me
Dreams that I believed
Convinced my destiny
I was meant to be alone
But how can you know how a star looks
If you've never looked at the sky
I couldn't have told you what blue is
Till I looked into your eyes,
Or how soft the feel of a cloud is
'Till I was touching your skin
The world is a wonder of wonders I'd never seen
I never imagined the power
I never imagined the need
I never imagined what love is
now love is all I dream
How wonderful was the awakening
Now everything is the sunrise
Painted in sounds of your breathing
Colored by your sighs
I never knew
what it was to - love
Much too sensible too reasonable
Ever to believe in miracles
But now you've come to me
Changed my destiny
I'll never be alone
I never imagined the power
I never imagined the need
I never imagined what love is
now love is all I dream
How wonderful was the awakening
Now everything is the sunrise
Painted in sounds of your breathing
Colored by your sighs
I never imagined the power
I never imagined the need
I never imagined what love is
now love is all I dream
I never imagined the power
I never knew
what it was to - love"
Looking Back,"We would fall asleep
Talking ‘bout our dreams
Waiting for eighteen
Is never what it seems
We were young and naive
Didn't know what we need
We were in such a rush to grow up
We were restless, confused
Summer nights on the roof
Didn't know what was in front of us
Chasing the high life
Stuck in the low lights
But we never know what we have
Until it's over and we're looking back
Speeding through red lights
We had a good ride
But we never know what we have
Until it's over and we're looking back
All these memories
Made me feel at home
When I walk these streets
I'm the only one, I know
We were young and naive
Didn't know what we need
We were in such a rush to grow up
Now it's too late to save
All the seasons have changed
Didn't know what was in front of us
Chasing the high life
Stuck in the low lights
But we never know what we have
Until it's over and we're looking back
Speeding through red lights
We had a good ride
But we never know what we have
Until it's over and we're looking back
Chasing the high life
Stuck in the low lights
But we never know what we have
Until it's over and we're looking back
Speeding through red lights
We had a good ride
But we never know what we have
Until it's over and we're looking back
Yeah we never know what we have
Until it's over and we're looking back"
Mon Alliée (The Best In Me),"La nuit comme un écho

Story Of My Life,"Everybody told me that I'd never be someone,
I'm not a puppet on a string no, no I'm not,
Everybody said that I was always breaking rules,
Why would I ever wanna put myself inside a box.
I don't care, what they say,
And who are they, anyway.
The story of my life, it's mine,
I made it on my own, that's right,
And now I sing, na na na na na na, Hey! Hey! Hey!
My life, it's mine, my my life it's mine.
They said if I was blonde that I could make it so I did it,
Then they said you're almost perfect but you talk too much. HA!
Try to dumb it down a little, make sure that you're in the middle,
Rock it all you want but make it pop enough!
I don't care, what they say,
And who are they, anyway,
The story of my life, It's Mine,
I made it on my own, that's right

That I shouldn’t think

Know well where to go

YOU,"Hand on my hand
Fingertips trembling
This feeling I can't understand

We might only have tonight
Hold me tight and let's ignite
And for the moment I
I just wanna dance with you
tonight I wanna
I just wanna dance with you
You know you wanna
My lips find yours
And just like a muse you're taking over me
I like it. I want more.
Sing it to me

Attention,"I find myself longing for attention.
I'm not myself doing what I do.
I know I may have hurt someone I love along the way, it wasn't my intention.
I lost myself doing what I do.
I, just want your attention.
Oh, the crazy things I do.
So why, why do I think it's okay,
not being me 'cause of you?
And what do you want me to say?
What do you want me to do,
To get your attention?
'Cause I just want your attention.
I fool myself just to make you happy.
And when I do, it's all the same to you.
Oh, the crazy things I do.
So why, why do I think it's okay,
not being me 'cause of you?
And what do you want me to say?
What do you want me to do,
To get your attention?
Oh, I don't wanna do this no more

On the dance floor,
Oh.....!

Empires,"Ashes to ashes dust into dust
I'll follow you through black

No looking down
There's fool's gold in our eyes

Happens so easy
Playing with fire
Maybe it's you and me
Burning an empire
Is it our fault we
Rise and fall
Like moth to a flame
Like birds to a pane of glass
Hoping for change but we do the same
We're gasoline and a match
No looking down
There's fool's gold in our eyes
Burning an empire
Happens so easy
Playing with fire
Maybe it's you and me
Burning an empire
Is it our fault we
Rise and fall
We just want it all
Used to be a tower so tall
Now we're holding up, crumbling walls
We rise and fall
Moth to a flame as we do the same
Like a bird to a pane of glass
Burning an empire
Happens so easy
Playing with fire
Maybe it's you and me
Burning an empire
Is it our fault we
Rise and fall"
Medo De Sentir,"Is there any way out?
I think I can no longer feel love
And if love invites me
I can no longer accept
Feels just like a routine
This loneliness insists in coming back to me
I was never like this
But now I’m afraid to feel anything
Go and ask time, for it knows all about me
Go and ask time, for it knows all about me
If you take my hand
I don't really know how to react
If you speak from the heart
It seems like I'm hearing once again
Just one more illusion
That will quickly fade away
I was never like this
But now I’m afraid to feel anything
Go and ask time, for it knows all about me
Go and ask time, for it knows all about me
What time keeps says everything I feel about you
I’ve tried to change my ways
But life has taken
The best that I had inside me
And if one day I return
Will you wait for me?
I was never like this
But now I am afraid to feel anything
Go and ask time, for it knows all about me
Go and ask time, for it knows all about me
What time keeps says everything I feel about you"
Alcohol You,"The sun is rising ink
For me its hard to blink
I'm falling
I wrote some stupid words
Before I lost my mind
And called you
A taste of bittersweet
to chase the memories
Blue heaven
I need you but it hurts
to feel like I deserve
your weapons
Why do fairytales fail baby
Mumbling in the dark to save me
Love you from the bottom of my...
Alcohol you when I'm drunk
I do it 'cause you're not around
This pain's the only thing that I can't refuse
They warned me but I think it's only fake news
I will 'cohol' you when I'm drunk
If you're the enemy
then maybe I'm too weak to see it
The fire's in my chest
But I won't let my head
believe it
If this is just a dream
Don't wake me in between
I mean it
You lied so many times
but right between the lines
I read it
Why do fairytales fail baby
Mumbling in the dark to save me
Love you from the bottom of my...
Alcohol you when I'm drunk
I do it 'cause you're not around
This pain's the only thing that I can't refuse
They warned me but I think it's only fake news
I will 'cohol' you when I'm drunk
I'll 'cohol' you when I'm drunk
I will call you when I'm... strong"

Some people think our love is freaky, freaky, freaky
They say we're cray
And must be faking

Drinks on rooftops and kiss in the dark

Hasta La Vista,"One, two, three, it's done,
This is no longer fun,
Raise your hands on my mark
You're with her again, again, I see the two of you,
You're the reason I can't sleep
The silence is deafening
It will be the two of us,
Crippled,
You with no heart and me losing sleep.
Although sometimes I'm a little crazy
Relationship with me is never lazy,
You always choose the wrong one
Take it or leave it, my love.
Hasta la vista, baby
I have a new plan, new plan, my dear
Hasta la vista, baby
It's crystal clear, yes, it's crystal clear
You should thank me for loving you
For liking what I see,
Well, sorry that you didn't like me
Hasta la vista, baby
One, two, three, it's done,
This is no longer fun,
Raise your hands on my mark
You're with her again, again, I see the two of you,
You're the reason I can't sleep
The silence is deafening
This is not vanity
In love that's cute but psycho
Oh yes, I want to surrender
And turn the world upside down
You and me on the edge of madness when I signal the end
Signal the end, ah yeah"
Voda,"Let's move on, into a new time,
Let's run away, far from here.
Let's not stop anywhere,
The night will be long.
You can hear my reason pounding.
As a wanderer you know,
The longest way is the one
That leads from words to deeds.
Water!
During the storm, I lie
In you till the end.
The water gushes …
But cannot reach us inside.
Let's drive on, the other way,
Beyond light, belief.
A torn-up chair stands there,
Awaiting someone,
Awaiting a child.
Water!
During the storm, I lie
In you till the end.
The water gushes …
But cannot reach us inside.
It rises and it rings,
The root, my unease without end.
The water gushes …
But cannot reach us inside,
No, it cannot reach us inside."

Afraid in the dark

Don't be offended
Don't mind my mood
Changing like the weather
God knows I try to hold it all together
Oh, I'm getting older
And it ain't what I thought it would be
Wide awake
The planet spins around
A little too fast for me
Most of the time
Lost control
My thoughts are flickering
Just like satellites
Lost in the sky
Don't take it personally
Don't be offended
Don't mind my mood
Changing like the weather
God knows I try to hold it all together
I'm getting older
And it ain't what I thought it would be
One day I'll find
Some peace of mind
And then I'll stop being afraid
I won't make it through the night

The less I know
Through every high and every low
Oh, I grow
The more I learn
The less I know
Through every high and every low
Oh, I grow"

rue and periwinkle

hurries from the grove

You are beautiful Katrusia
My dear Katrusia
I’m loving you
I’m loving you

Nightingale nightingale do not sing so early
my heart feels no joy again
Nightingale nightingale oh what should I do
I could fall in love with him I could not forget him
If I hadn't known that
I wouldn't have gone out with you
I wouldn't have gone into the valley
I wouldn't have broken the guelder rose

Do not sing so early
I feel no joy

My Last Breath,"Some people let go
Some people let love slip away
But I'm gonna hold on
When no one believes I'll keep the faith
And I know that we're in trouble
But I swear that we'll survive
If we were deep sea divers
And no one came to find us
If you had nothing left
I'd give you my last breath
I'd give you my last breath
We all need a lifeline
Someone to call when we're alone
It's all good in the good times
But I'll still be there when it all goes wrong, yes I will
If we were deep sea divers
And no one came to find us
If you had nothing left
I'd give you my last breath
I'd give you my last breath
And I know that we're in trouble,
But I swear that we'll survive
If we were deep sea divers
And no one came to find us

The world fell on me
You ran away from me, my friends ran away
There is no light
God doesn't forgive me
I yelled voiceless
Bundle tears in my hand
They are rusty
I looked for you through empty hearts
And realized nothing seduces me
I am alone
Yes, I am alone
When I groaned, you laughed like a fool
I deserved to be dragged
I am guilty
Yes, I am guilty
God doesn't forgive me
World fell on me
You ran away from me, my friends ran away

The Wrong Place,"I wake up, and I think
I could use another drink
I'm reaching for a smoke
to forget about last night
I get up cause I need
a shot of instant remedy
I put a record on
that makes me think about last night
It all ended in the weirdest trip
you started acting way too hip
That's why
I ignored you for a long, long time
but then you had the best opening line
You're in the wrong place
You're lying next to me.
I don't know where to hide
I see your smiley face
that makes me wanna cry
What was I thinking
cause all we did was fight
Don't you ever dare to wear my Johnny Cash T-shirt
You're in the wrong place
You wake up, and you think
You won't need another drink
You don't want me to smoke
Though I didn't stop last night
You get up cause you need
an organic cup of tea
You put a record on
That makes you think about last night
You confused me with your blurry eyes
Thought you were a different kind of guy
That's why
I took you to my messy place
but it felt as if we were in a different space.
You're in the wrong place
You're lying next to me
I don't know where to hide
I see your smiley face

Growing Up Is Getting Old,"Playing tetris with my feelings
Trynna keep them all inside
Hollow shadows and my soul is spilling over, I'm out of time
Closing every door
Wanna be alone
Lonely is a way that I survive
Sick of wanting more
Sitting on the floor
Wondering where all my feelings go
Nervous system's aching
Growing up is getting old
Don't get it, there's an ocean of emotion that I'm carrying inside
I am cautious,
Cause I've never understood how so much can fit in little me
Star crossed soul
And I'm used to letting go
Sink deeper in the flow of it
My demons know exactly where my fears
Are hiding all my tears
I'm torn by nervous system's aching
Growing up is getting old
Anxiety is draining
Getting up is growing old
And if I ever take that second to leave my worries behind
Maybe I could tread the waters of time,
Get out of my mind
Growing up is getting old
Getting up is growing old
If your world is breaking
And growing up is getting old
Know that you're worth saving
And getting up is all you've got"

And rise to come show you who I am
I feel fire inside
My hearts desire
I’m breaking free from you

A dancefloor where hearts swell up and break apart
We'll never be more alive than right here and now
All people on the floor have lost their minds
Let us practice on each other
No one knows how you do it, so
Let us practice on each other
Very soon we'll both be grown ups
You're the woman, I'm the man
All people on the floor have lost their minds
Let us practice on each other"
The Lucky One,"Wonder if it ever crossed your mind
That what we had was really unbelievable
Unbeatable. A miracle.
Why'd you have to go and mess it up
Why'd you have to make what was unbreakable
Shakeable, unsaveable.
Now it is too late to cross your fingers
I am wide awake and not a dreamer
Hate it but it seems the dreams were never true
For a little while the fates were with us
Wonder why they had to turn against us
I could make a wish but there is no use
I can feel
Even though I'm numb
The change to come
Will hurt someone
I can see
This time it isn't me
I might be
The lucky one
I don't need a crystal ball to show me
Baby it is plain that you don't know me
When it comes to you I'm better off alone
I don't need a crystal ball to make me
Realise that if I stay you'll break me
Every sign is saying I should be gone
I should be gone
Thought I had a cloud over my head
It had to be my fault that it kept raining down
Until now I figured out
That if I had the nerve to say goodbye
I could look for clearer skies up over head
Weather says
Sun instead
I don't need a crystal ball to show me
Baby it is plain that you don't know me
When it comes to you I'm better off alone
I don't need a crystal ball to make me
Realise that if I stay you'll break me
Every sign is saying I should be gone
I should be gone
I can feel
Even though I'm numb
The change to come
Will hurt someone
I can see
This time it isn't me
I might be
The lucky one
I don't need a crystal ball to show me
Baby it is plain that you don't know me
When it comes to you I'm better off alone
I don't need a crystal ball to make me
Realise that if I stay you'll break me
Every sign is saying I should be gone
I should be gone"
Dark Side,"Put your middle fingers up
Take a shot
Throw it up and don’t stop
I’m, I’m, I’m
Living that life on the dark side
Every psycho in the scene
Hands up and follow me saying
Empire of the freaks
All drinks on me
Just another night on my pitch black paradise
Don’t wanna cry so I gotta get paralyzed
My body is my weapon so I keep it loaded
’Til I’m all over the place like my head exploded
Don’t waste your prayers
They can’t save us
Lifestyles of the sick and dangerous
Put your middle fingers up
Take a shot
Throw it up and don’t stop
I’m, I’m, I’m
Living that life on the dark side
Like the 27 club
Headshot
We don’t wanna grow up
I’m, I’m, I’m
Living that life on the dark side
Life on the dark side
Every psycho in the scene
Hands up and follow me saying
Empire of the freaks
All drinks on me
I’m in a cave of man-made misery
Diggin’ a grave for myself and my enemies
Of all the dark things that keep me wasted
You’re the sweetest I’ve ever tasted
Put your middle fingers up
Take a shot
Throw it up and don’t stop
I’m, I’m, I’m
Living that life on the dark side
Like the 27 club
Headshot
We don’t wanna grow up
I’m, I’m, I’m

Voilà,"Listen to me
Me the half-singer
Talk about me
To your loves, to your friends
Tell them about this black eyed girl and her crazy dream
What I want is to write stories that reach you
That's all
Here it is, here it is, this is who I am
Here I am even though exposed I'm afraid, yes
Here I am in the noise and in the silence
Look at me, or at least what's left of it
Look at me, before I hate myself
What to tell you that another's lips won't tell you
It's not much but me all that I have I put it there, that's it
Here it is, here it is, this is who I am
Here I am even if stripped naked it's over
It's my face it's my cry, here I am, too bad
Here it is, here it is, here it is right here
Me, my dream, my desire, as I die of it, as I laugh at it
Here I am in the noise and in the silence
Don't go, I'm begging you stay a long time
It may not save me, no
But do without you, I don't know how
Love me as we love a friend who is gone forever
I want people to love me because I don't know how to like my outlines
Here it is, here it is, this is who I am
Here I am even if stripped naked it's over
Here I am in the noise and in the fury too
Look at me finally and my eyes and my hands
All I have is here, it's my face, it's my cry
Here I am, here I am, here I am
There, there, there, there
here"
You,"Sunshine, I wanna touch you.
Wind blow, I wanna see you.
I wanna touch, I wanna see,
I wanna be, with you.
Ocean, I wanna hear you.
Mountain, I wanna feel you.
I wanna hear, I wanna feel,
I wanna be, with you.
You're everywhere, where I am.
You're in everything, that I do.
My love, my love,
I wanna be with you.
You uuu aaaaa

I wanna be with you."
I Don't Feel Hate,"I don't feel hate
I just feel sorry
you feel so very clever whenever you find another way to wear me down
But I don't feel hate
I just feel sorry
so you can wiggle with that middle finger it'll never wiggle back to you
'cause i don't feel
sorry
I really don't care that you want to bash me
do it with flair and I'll let you be
(I'll let you be common Eileen)
but don't you dare, mmm, to get angry when you realise those words just don’t hit me (whaaat?)
Cause I don't feel hate
I just feel sorry
you feel so very clever whenever you find another way to wear me down
But I don't feel hate
I just feel sorry
so you can wiggle with that middle finger it'll never wiggle back to you
'cause i don't feel
hate
sorry
I really don't mind to be your rival
cause for your kind it's essential for survival (say what)
(he did not just say that)
yes I did, and I feel sorry, I don't feel hate, that's the whole point of the song
I guess you need patronization
as some kind of validation:
you won't cope with the frustration
that your random me-fixation
is another affirmation
that you're just a hateful person who's not really better than me!
(trumpet and whistle duet)
(tap break)
(I don't feel hate)
I don't feel hate
(I just feel sorry)
I just feel sorry
(you feel so very clever whenever you find another way to wear me down)
Meine Damen und Herren das war’s mit “I Don’t Feel Hate” ich hoffe Sie haben noch ein derbe nices Leben und bis bald.

No no no no

don’t wear me down

I don't feel hate

Last Dance,"My heart was born a radical
electric and dynamical
I've never listened to the remedies
but no forevers no eternities
Holding on beyond the night
for a shadow that feels right
holding on beyond the night
to you
If the dreams we made are made of fire
I would give a life just to live the dream again
if our hearts are hanging on a wire
let’s forget the world below and dance
Until the end
Let’s Dance
Our last dance
Rocking romance
This isn’t (ain’t) our last last dance
(or this ain’t our last dance.)
My heart was born in neon lights
floating in space like satellites
looking for signs of life tonight
as we collide in black and white
Holding on beyond the night
for a shadow that feels right
holding on beyond the night
to you
If the dreams we made are made of fire
I would give a life just to live the dream again
Take a deeper breath before we touch
running out of time let’s use it up
hold me before the morning comes"
10 Years,"We’ve been together for a decade now
Still everyday I’m loving you more
If I could do it all again
I’d probably do it all the same as before
I don’t wanna know what would have happened if I never had had your love
I didn’t become myself before I met you
I don’t wanna know what would have happened if I never had felt your love
Everything about you I like
We started out so fast
Now we can take it slower
Love takes some time, takes a little time so take a little time
As it ages like wine
How does it keep getting better
Everyday our love finds a new way to grow
The time we spend together
Simply feels good
We got a good thing going
And just when I thought that my heart was full
I found places that I never explored
You’re so fascinating
I can’t remember the last time I was bored
I don’t wanna know what would have happened if I never had had your love
I didn’t become myself before I met you
I don’t wanna know what would have happened if I never had felt your love
Everything about you I like
How does it keep getting better
Everyday our love finds a new way to grow
The time we spend together
Simply feels good
We got a good thing going
How does it keep getting better
Everyday our love finds a new way to grow
The time we spend together
Simply feels good
We got a good thing going"
MAPS,"I’m gonna let, down all the armour,
Let out the power, that I’ve been hiding,
Not afraid, of the monsters,
Of the nightmares, that I’ve been fighting.
Easy to run, harder to stay,
Finding colours in the grey,
Thought I was done, but I got it wrong,
I fell twice, I'm twice as strong
I've been searching all the wrong places,
I've been trying too many faces,
Only one way to go,
This is the way back home.
(I ) had to take, all of the long ways,
All the wrong ways, cause I couldn’t see,
All the signs, all of the mistakes,
Pointing one way, to get back to me.
It’s easy to run, harder to stay,
Finding colours in the grey,
Thought I was done, but I got it wrong,
I fell twice, I'm twice as strong.
I've been searching all the wrong places,

Only one way to go,
This is the way back home.
I've been searching all the wrong places,
I've been trying too many faces,
Only one way to go,
This is the way back home.
My soul is a map,
My heart is a compass,
I am the road.
There’s only one way to go,
This is the way back home.

Set Me Free,"Take a look what we've become

Feeling like in prison
Looking for the reason
I don't wanna say goodbye
Feels like no tomorrow
Everywhere that I go
Babe I'm gonna lose my mind
Just another story
Tell me not to worry
And everything will be just fine
Used to be your treasure
Now I'm gone forever
Think I'm going back in time

Used to call us cheesy
It was paradise
In my bed so lonely
You're the one and only
Hell I know I paid my price
Clock is ticking tik tak
Everything is צ'יק צ'ק

People tell me honey

Set the place on fire

Feel my beating heart and set me free
Set me Free

Just set me free"
Zitti E Buoni,"They don’t know what I am talkin’ about
Dirty clothes, bro, muddy clothes
Yellow ‘cig stains on my finger
I am walkin’ with my ‘cig
Excuse me, but I truly believe
That I can make this jump
And even if the road is uphill
That’s why I am training now
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
Bring out the actors
You’d better not make anymore mistakes
You’d better be quiet and behave
Around here, there are strange people-like dealers
Too many nights I've spent locked outside
Now I'm kicking these doors
Eyes up like climbers
So excuse me mum if I'm always out, but
I'm out of my mind, but different from them
And you are out of your mind, but different from them
We are out of our minds, but different from them
We are out of our minds, but different from them
I've written pages and pages, I've seen the salt then the tears
These machine-men not climbing the rapids
I’ve written on a tombstone, in my house there's no God
But if you find the sense of time you'll climb out of your oblivion
And there's no wind stopping the natural power
From the right point of view you feel the thrill of the wind
With wax wings on my back I'll seek that high
If you want to stop me try again, try cutting my head off because
I'm out of my mind, but different from them
And you are out of your mind, but different from them
We are out of our minds, but different from them
We are out of our minds, but different from them
They talk, unfortunately people talk
They don't know what they talk about
You, bring me where I stay afloat
Cause here i can’t breathe
They talk, unfortunately people talk
They don't know what they are talkin’ about
You, bring me where I stay afloat
Cause here I can’t breathe
They talk, unfortunately people talk
They don't know what they are talkin’ about
You, bring me where I stay afloat
Cause here I can’t breathe
But I'm out of my mind, but different from them
And you are out of your mind, but different from them
We are out of our minds, but different from them
We are out of our minds, but different from them
We're different from them"
The Moon Is Rising,"The queen of the night is coming
The blood moon is rising
When I walk in like this
With and attitude
You should know that
I’m coming after you
You can run, you can hide
But you’re mesmerized
In your mind I am
Already idolized
Playing dirty -
Not my case!
Giving up hopes -
Not my case!
Being envious -
Not my case!
If you got something to say,
Say it to my face!
The queen of the night is coming
The blood moon is rising

Bring the passion inside,
Let me touch your fate
I will lead, I will guide you
On your way
I am here to remind
You’re in the right place
My rules, your rules
I’m a woman, I’m a ruler
My rules, your rules
I’m accepting only true love
My rules, your rules
I’m a woman, I’m a ruler
You got something to say,
Say it to my face
My rules, your rules
Getting ready for the parade
My rules, your rules
No excuses, if it’s too late
My rules, your rules
Everybody follow my way
You got something to say,
Say it to my face!

Discoteque,"Ok, I feel the rhythm.
Something’s going on here.
The music flows through my veins.
It's taking over me.
It's slowly kickin’ in.
My eyes are blinking
And I don’t know what is happening.
I can’t control it.
Don’t wanna end it.
There’s no one here
And I don’t care
I feel it’s safe to dance alone.
Let's discoteque right at my home.
It is ok to dance alone.
Dance alone, dance alone, dance alone, dance alone
I got the moves - it's gonna blow.
By dancing on my own
I'm healing wounded soul.
My body's shaking,
Heart is breaking, have to let it go.
I need to get up.
And put my hands up.
There’s no one here
And I don’t care
I feel it’s safe to dance alone.
Let's discoteque right at my home.
It is ok to dance alone.
Dance alone, dance alone, dance alone, dance alone

Alone tonight

Just took a little kiss to show how I was missing out
Compared to you no one has anything to brag about
Your lips are honey sweet

Now I want only one
Sugar, sugar on my tongue
I need your kisses, Baby got to keep ‘em coming, ay, ay, ay
Oh, sugar

Here I Stand,"There are times when I remember back
Wish to hug the child about to crack
I’ll tell’him: “wait it won’t be long
Trust your heart and just stay strong”

Not knowing it’s what makes us
This is how we found our way
Now here I stand there’s no pretend
My walls are down and my hearts in your hand
Unchain my wings and the oceans of tears
All fade to black with the sum of my years
They all tried to break us (tried to break)
Not knowing it’s what makes us (they don’t know)
This is how we found our way

My walls are down and my heart in your hand

And all I do is smile, all for you!

I can’t make her stay
When I know that she’s so far above
How could she ever love

Here in the dark, inside the hole in my heart
I’m fighting all of my demons tryna tear me apart
And I’m still not sure
What you ever saw - in me
No
I’m a, I’m a fallen angel
And no matter where my heart is there’s no way I’ll ever
Reach up to Heaven - to you
She’s so far outta this world
No way I could ever be with her
Cuz I know Heaven’s your home
That’s where angels belong
And it wouldn’t be fair
If I keep you down here

I’m fighting all of my demons tryna tear me apart
And I’m still not sure
What you ever saw - in me
No
I’m a, I’m a fallen angel

Love Is On My Side,"Left home when I was only sweet sixteen
Chasing blind love and a bunch of broken dreams
Don't know how I thought I'd be a queen
I could do anything
But somehow I end up here I don't know why
I still believe that
Love is on my side
Love is on my side
Love is on my side
Maybe not tonight
I can feel it when it rains
I can feel it still runnin' through my veins
Ran so fast I couldn't even grow
Forgot where I belong
Sold my body on a dirty cold floor
Yet I believe that
I believe that
Love is on my side
Love is on my side
Love is on my side
My side
Maybe not tonight
Love is...
Love is...
Love is...
Love is on my side
Maybe not tonight"
Amnesia,"Once upon a time

You are not alone, not alone now
Oh, I lost myself tryna to have it all

Cuz you're not alone , not alone
I tried to fight it but it's getting strong , getting strong
Oh I lost myself tryna have it all
Self love amnesia, don't worry if you got it cuz you're not alone
Giving all they want might make you lose control
They keep preaching words like I should know
People always say be careful what you're wishing for
If you feel what I feel,
See what I see
Don't bring yourself down
You are not alone, not alone now
Oh, I lost myself tryna to have it all
This world feels in rush and they say they know it all

How do You cross a field thru the fire?
How do you cross the field if you’re alone?
Heeeey?
Should I wait for a helpful hand?
Whaaat?
Who will stretch out for me, girls?
For ages now
From night till dawn
From the deepest of the night
We are waiting for a ship
A Sailing ship
Waiting very much
From night till dawn
Waiting for a ship
Waiting for a ship
But what’s the wait?
Stand up, let’s go!
Every Russian Woman
Needs to know
You're strong enough to bounce against the wall
What’s the rattling about?
Hey, beauty!
Are you waiting for your Prince?
Hey, beauty!
You’re 30!
Hello? Where are your kids?
You are cute overall
But should lose some weight
Wear something longer
Wear something shorter
Oh you grew up without a father?
You should do what you don’t want to
You sure you’d don’t want to?
Don’t want to?
You SHOULD!
Listen up, really!
We’re not a flock
Hey, crows, shoo!
Leave me alone (give me a break)
Now learn it by heart:
I don’t blame you a bit
But damn do I like myself
They just fight, always fight
Go round and round to just fight
But never pray
Boy without a father
Girl with no dad
But this broken family
Can’t break me"
Adrenalina,"I’m burnin up with affliction
Come gimme your full attention
I want you to tame my fire now
Who-o-o-o-oh

Flo Rida
Senhit

Step in the party
Cause she know to do my body like hot coals
Gasoline, kerosene, stop drop roll
I can’t blame it on the stove
911 when she is coming down the pole
Yeaaa we like flames when we touch
Can’t get enough
We get ignited so excited
You can feel the rush
Like cloud fire, more fire
When we in the club
Put out my lighter I got the heat
She got me burning up
So hot look at it steams up
We got the blaze so we in inferno when we team up
Hot spot, hot girl have you seen her
We up in smoke, fireworks adrenalina

Amen,"Hey child,
Why ya hiding from the light?
Why ya cowering in fright?
Don't tell yourself
The heavens cast you out
And you've fallen from grace.
You'll get beaten and bruised,
You'll be scarred unto your core,
But it's gonna make you who you are.
When ya learn to heal,
When ya learn to rise again,
You can tell the sun amen.
Hallelujah,
We're glorious!
Hallelujah,
The day is dawning!
The storm's relentless,
But everybody knows,
Everybody knows
We're born to the fight.
Hey child,
The fear’ll never go away;
Might as well accept it now.
Learn to persevere,
Learn to count your blessings down…
Greet the future with amen.
Hallelujah,
We're glorious!
Hallelujah,
The day is dawning!
The storm's relentless,
But everybody knows,
Everybody knows
We're born to the fight.
Not until the rain has stopped,
Not until the thunder's hushed
Are we at rest, are we at peace… just imagine it.
Not until the storm has passed,
Not until it's quiet,
Can the heart that's broken cry.
Hallelujah,
We're glorious!
Hallelujah,
The day is dawning!
The storm's relentless,
But everybody knows,
Everybody knows
We're born to the fight.
Hey child,
Why ya hiding from the light?"
Voy A Quedarme,"Stay tonight to watch the sunrise
To feel your voice
Caressing me
Stay one more second,
there is nothing to lose
While drawing a sea
Of memories in your skin
I have come down to the sky to discover
That hides in your eyes
Just a few inches away from me
I'm going to stay and I promise
To love you more than yesterday
I'm going to kiss you very slowly
Like the first time
And leave behind the fear
With your soul between my fingers
Stay
Because I'm going to stay
I know there are many like me
with so much to offer
But I swear that this love
no one can beat it
And even if our dance gave
a step backwards
Don't worry I
With you I will always dance
What difference does it make if the world collapses today
or what will happen tomorrow
That I'm not leaving your side
I'm going to stay and I promise
To love you more than yesterday
I'm going to kiss you very slowly
Like the first time
And leave behind the fear
With your soul between my fingers
Stay
Because I'm going to stay
By your side even if the ground is shaking
The sun goes out
The sky is falling
Just a few centimeters away
And leave behind the fear
With your soul between my fingers
Stay
Because I'm going to stay"
Voices,"There’s fire in the rain
But we’ll get up again
We’re thousand miles apart
But we’ll overcome
I’ll never let you down
World is turning us around
But I feel it in my heart
Let’s make a brand new start
Can’t stop us now forget the haters
Get up and live and make it matter
There’s more to life so go ahead and sing it out
Can you hear a million voices
Calling out in the rain
You know we got a million choices
So go get out and let it rain
A million voices voices
A million voices voices....
There’s fire in the rain
And I can feel your pain
Painting all the scars in
The colors of change
Don’t let them hold you down
Don’t let them hold you down
Go shooting like a star
The star you are
Can’t stop us now forget the haters
Get up and live and make it matter
There’s more to life so go ahead and sing it out
Can you hear a million voices
Calling out in the rain
You know we got a million choices
So go get out and let it rain
A million voices voices
A million voices voices....
Can you hear them?
Can you hear them?
Can you hear a million voices
Calling out in the rain
You know we got a million choices
So go get out and let it rain
A million voices voices
A million voices voices...."
Tout l'Univers,"Let the wind brush
His/her hand over my shoulder
The void in my head
Not a single place to hide
The dawn is fading
Behind a field of ruins
It’s time to grow up
Don’t hold yourself back
I see pieces of you behind us
And I see what pain has made of me
The whole universe
Our two hearts under the ground
At the centre of the rifts where everything explodes
Being at the point of impact
Without you
What will happen to our breaths
If they stay on the shore?
This love that wrings us out
I see pieces of you behind us
And I see what pain has made of me
The whole universe
Our two hearts under the ground
At the centre of the rifts where everything explodes
Being at the point of impact
Without you
Behind my eyelids
Get some air
Ah
(The whole universe)
(Our two hearts under the ground)
At the centre of the rifts and the aftershocks
We will meet at the point of impact
How can we heal our exploding hearts
The whole universe"
Birth Of A New Age,"Skin as rich as a starlit night
Your rhythm is rebellion
Deep currents running in the rivers of your eyes
Your rhythm is rebellion
They spat on your crown
And they poisoned your ground
Your rhythm is rebellion
They burned your heroes at the stake
But your voice will echo all their names
This ain’t the end, no!
It’s the birth of a new age
Yu no man broko mi
Soul blazing like a hurricane
Your rhythm is rebellion
Spirit roaring wild like untamed flames
Your rhythm is rebellion
They buried your gods
They imprisoned your thoughts
Your rhythm is rebellion
They tried to drain you of your faith
But you are the rage that melts the chains
This ain’t the end, no!
It’s the birth of a new age
We are the fruit
Adorning the legacy
Of every forgotten revolutionary
Born in resilience
Proud like a lion
We are the birth of a new age
Yu no man broko mi
Mi na afu sensi"
Shum,"Oh Spring song, Spring song
Where have you spent your Winter?
In the garden, sitting on a maple tree
You’ve been spinning a shirt.
There on the edge of a forest
An owl is blowing into the water.
I’ll sing a song -
Let her hear it.
Shum, get twined with periwinkle
I’m singing the spring song to you.
Sowing, sowing, sowing, sowing hemp plants,
Sowing, sowing, sowing, sowing green ones.
Come Spring, come
Don’t wait around
We’ll go outside
to love each other.
Oh Spring, our Miss,
Look in our window.
We had sang our song
And the Sun shined on.
Come on, come on, let’s twine the Shum,
Twine the Shum, dance it around.
Sowing, sowing, sowing, sowing hemp plants,
Sowing, sowing, sowing, sowing green ones.
Shum, get twined, get twined!
Shum, get spread with periwinkle.
Sowing, sowing, sowing, sowing hemp plants,
Sowing, sowing, sowing, sowing green ones.
Oh Spring song, Spring song

Come on, come on, we’ve made some noise.
Made some noise and awoke the Spring.

We’re cool under pressure
And that’s all we need

Sekret,"Hey, do you remember those nights?
They remain a secret....
Come on up x8
The boy is coming from the mountains
And he came here to find it
Goin‘ mad when I whine it
Come babe, come put my hands on your body
Come on closer to me, me ya
Cause I love when ya near near
“Xhamadanin me vija vija”
Come baby put it on me ya
Hey, I will never regret
You will be my secret
Baby feel my body, touch, touch it, I like it
Hey, I will never regret
You will keep my secret
But I do not know, I do not know how I got there
I do not know how else you left me
Even today I want to say it
Even 1 and 2
1, 2, 3
Take it!
You made my life like a game
Plane! You got it, you got it
You know I want it, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me"
Snap,"It‘s 4am
I can‘t turn my head off
Wishing these memories would fade
They never do
Turns out people lied
They said just snap your fingers
As if it was really that easy
For me to get over you
I just need time
Snappin‘ 1, 2, where are you?
You‘re still in my heart
Snappin 3, 4, don‘t need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
‘Cause I might snap
I‘m writing a song
Said this is the last one
But how many last songs are left?
I‘m losing count
Since June 22
My heart‘s been on fire
I‘ve been spending my nights
In the rain trying to put it out
So I‘m snappin 1, 2, where are you?
You‘re still in my heart
Snappin 3, 4, don‘t need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
‘Cause I might snap
Oh-oh, Cause I might snap
Oh-oh
And if one more person says you should get over it
Oh I might stop talking to people before I snap, snap, snap
Oh I might stop talking to people before I snap
Snappin 1, 2, where are you? (Where are you?)
You‘re still in my heart (Still in my heart)
Snappin 3, 4, don‘t need you here anymore (Need you here anymore)
Get out of my heart
‘Cause I might snap
Oh-oh, Cause I might snap
Oh-oh (Get out of my heart)
Cause I might snap
Get out of my heart, yeah
Cause I might snap"
Not The Same,"I was told at 6 years old
They‘d avoid me if my heart was cold
Found it hard to talk and speak my mind
They never liked the things that I would like
Cause you‘re told to play but you‘re not the same
As the other kids playing the same game
Try to jump on in but they push away so far away
I‘m not the same no
I‘m not the same no
Years went by I tried and tried
My father asked me if today I smiled
I said yes I did, but that‘s a lie
Oh I always tell those lies
Then you run and hide, hide the break inside
Till you realise that the light shines bright
Through those oh who‘ve broke inside
I‘m not the same no
I‘m not the same no
I‘m not the same no
I‘m not the same no
Cause you never want to be the kind of person
Who can‘t work it for those ones who can not word it
Cause you‘ve been the kind of person who felt this pain
Oh yeah I felt this pain
So you go and leave the pain and find another way
To make yourself another game, maybe one for all to play cause it‘s not
Just me who‘s not the same, we‘re not the same
We‘re not the same no
We‘re not the same no
We‘re not the same no
We‘re not the same no"
Halo,"Let me be your halo,

Let me be your halo,
Cuz we been through hell and back and all in one night
Medusa had the right idea
Beautiful something to fear
For hundreds years on and on and on
We‘re gonna be written among the stars
Posters on walls of young queens

Fade To Black,"Stay
The story barely started
Can’t you
Stay
Do you really want no part of this?
One so sweet
Reverie
You back off slowly through the door
You always go and blame the weather
The weather
It hurts so fast
When love goes bad
Until at last
We fade to black
And I’m numb, numb
Numb, numb
Wait
I need some time to fix this, can’t you wait?
We can’t afford to miss this
You back off slowly through the door
You always go and blame the weather
The weather
It hurts so fast
When love goes bad
Until at last
We fade to black
And I’m numb, numb
Numb, numb
We’re living in a memory
The present is the price I pay
Fade to black
We fade to black
We’re living in a memory
The present is the price I pay
It hurts so fast
When love goes bad
Until at last
We fade to black"
Miss You,"Sometimes I feel down
Sometimes I booze
Sometimes I fall
Sometimes I do wrong
One day I‘m cool
One day I‘m cold
And I‘ve been trying to escape my past
Give up on the sadness
That you left behind
I‘ve been trying to erase my mind
(But) You stay like a nightmare
When I close my eyes
Am I gonna miss you ? No
Promise I won‘t miss you? No
I‘m gonna break through? No
I‘ll never hate you
I‘ll never chase you
Sometimes I feel good
Sometimes I lose
My mind and my soul
That‘s when I see you
And out of the blue
I answer your call
And I‘ve been trying to escape my past
Give up on the sadness
That you left behind
I‘ve been trying to erase my mind
But you stay like a nightmare
When I close my eyes
Am I gonna miss you? No
Promise I won‘t miss you? No
I‘m gonna break through? No
I‘ll never hate you
I‘ll never chase you
Am I gonna miss you ? No
Promise I won‘t miss you? No
I‘m gonna break through? No
I‘ll never hate you
I‘ll never chase you
I got to make it to the bright side
I‘ve been lying when I said ""I‘m fine""
Want to find a way to feel alive
Am I gonna miss you ? No
Promise I won‘t miss you? No
I‘m gonna break through? No
I‘ll never hate you
I‘ll never chase you
Never feel bad
When love is gone
Life goes on
Don‘t wanna live my life waiting for your call
Sometimes I feel down
Sometimes I booze
Sometimes I fall."
Intention,"And I can move on from here
How simple: life goes on
Humble – that‘s how I feel
Sparking hot flames, holding on.
Younger days run so clear
Through my mind, replaying my crime
Tearing me up, spreading fear
Obsession in my own time.
What life‘s taken away, I‘m not missing
Will I sit back and sigh?
A thunder of thoughts, I‘m dismissing
Too scared to even try…
And in time I‘ve always known
I‘m never in the safety zone
I took the fight, but was I right?
They were sending me to war…
My intention is strong and real
Only power steals my will.
The illusion of safety‘s surreal
Don‘t let it go for the kill!
What life‘s taken away, I‘m not missing
Will I sit back and sigh?
A thunder of thoughts, I‘m dismissing
Too scared to even try…
And in time I‘ve always known
I‘m never in the safety zone
I took the fight, but was I right?
They were sending me to war…
I don‘t want to take on the pain
So, I go seek inner signs, or a calling
The more freedom I gain
The less real life I‘m recalling.
And in time I‘ve always known
I‘m never in the safety zone
I took the fight, but was I right?
They were sending me to war…"
Guilty Pleasure,"Guilty pleasure
Dreamt of you last night
Woke up
You weren‘t there
Five nights in a row
Of dreams
I‘d never share
You come without a warning
Early in the morning
Timing‘s never been our thing
Leaving me with guilt
The only souvenir you bring
I‘m with him and you‘re a secret treasure
He‘s devotion, you‘re a guilty pleasure
I‘m with him and this is real life, honey
Guess the joke‘s no longer funny
I‘m with him until the death do us part
But it doesn‘t do for this hungry heart
I‘m with him, but in my frantic head
You always come and say
Would you run away
Would you run away with me
Would you run away
Would you run away
One love is enough
That‘s all you ever get
Least that‘s what they tell you
Still, I can‘t forget
Eyes like burning ashes
Till the sunlight flashes
Can‘t recall what I‘ve been taught
Captivated by the thunderstorm
In which I‘m caught
I‘m with him and you‘re a secret treasure
He‘s devotion, you‘re a guilty pleasure
I‘m with him and this is real life, honey
Guess the joke‘s no longer funny
I‘m with him until the death do us part
But it doesn‘t do for this hungry heart
I‘m with him, but in my frantic head
You always come and say
Would you run away
Would you run away with me
Would you run away
Would you run away
In this real life there‘s no way
In this real life I have to stay
In this real life there‘s no way
In this real life"

Change my bed covers
I‘d change my heart

You‘re sailing around in my peripheral
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now, ohhh
Where are you now?
I‘ll ring the changes
Make a plan
I‘m small, but mighty
Yes, I can
I‘ll build a fortress
I‘ll build a wall
I‘ll be a queen
Invincible

Tried changing lovers
Changing my furniture
Change my bed covers

Oh, when all else is lost
The future still remains our own
I hope I hope I hope
I hope I hope
I hope I hope I hope
I hope I hope
We let them tell us what to do
Why why why
We live to die for worthy things
Oh ya ya ya
No matter what they try, tearing up our lives
I know we will always rise

Hey sing your heart out boy

Jezebel,"Midnight it‘s time to put your face on
Game set a killer shark in heels
I‘m just the first shot on your hit list
High kicks a predator on wheels
Woke up with bruises on my body
Hands tied like Jesus on the cross
Your name‘s in lipstick on the mirror
Jezebel... I don‘t know how you got in my blood
Was it the dangerous things you do
You always wanted to be a star
Jezebel... if you‘re the hunter then I‘m the prey
You lick your lips as you walk away
Your final kiss is to leave a scar
On a heart
Jezebel
At night you turn into a tiger
A girl who looks like she‘s a boy
The world‘s most ultimate survivor
Jezebel... I don‘t know how you got in my blood
Was it the dangerous things you do
You always wanted to be a star
Jezebel... if you‘re the hunter then I‘m the prey
You lick your lips as you walk away
Your final kiss is to leave a scar
On a heart
Sunrise you crawl under the covers
Sleep tight until the dying sun
Tonight you‘ll catch another lover
Jezebel... I don‘t know how you got in my blood
Was it the dangerous things you do
You always wanted to be a star
Jezebel... if you‘re the hunter then I‘m the prey
You lick your lips as you walk away
Your final kiss is to leave a scar
On a heart
Jezebel
Jezebel
Jezebel"

Let‘s go!
In the darkness of the woods germinates the night
The stars appear in the restless rustle
A feminine shadow twirls in the light of a torch
Ignoring the wild beasts I dance
I steal the fire from their gaze full of lust
And turn it into a song to sing in unison
She dances with the devil, so what?
I dance with the devil, so what?
Heat and mud, heat, party and mud
The forest vibrates with the dancing spark
Its enchanting magic rises up to the tall trees
Ignoring the wild beasts I dance
I steal the fire from their gaze full of lust
And turn it into a song to sing in unison
Fearless in the middle of the forest clearing, the spark is dancing
Raging souls twirl and twirl around her
Fearless in the middle of the forest clearing, the spark is dancing
Raging souls twirl and twirl around her

Rockstars,"Look where we are
We used to be the rockstars
Who never thought of no harm
‘Til this thing we call life stopped gleaming I wish there was a way to go back dreaming Remembering gets so hard
When time is moving so fast
Wish there was a way to know that we‘re in
The good old days before we all just leave ‘em
I tried getting rid of the pain
I tried to make it go away but it probably won‘t change
Always thinking ‘bout my own worries
Remember back when we had no worries?
Now life just ain‘t hitting the same
I sit and miss and reminisce about innocent old days
When I was afraid of nobody
Now I‘m afraid of being a nobody
Don‘t wanna leave my bed
I‘ll just stay and never get it together
‘Cause the voices in my head
They keep saying it‘ll never get better
Look where we are
We used to be the rockstars
Who never thought of no harm
‘Til this thing we call life stopped gleaming
I wish there was a way to go back dreaming
Remembering gets so hard
When time is moving so fast
Wish there was a way to know that we‘re in
The good old days before we all just leave ‘em
Sometimes I got this kinda sting that‘s right inside my chest
It‘s only purpose is convincing me that I‘m a mess
And even though it‘s always been an uninvited guest
It finds a way in nonetheless
Wish I could change my address
And you know
Just be somebody else for a couple of days
Although I‘m pretty sure we all feel the same kinda way
‘Cause if you think about it
Aren‘t we all set in a place
Where we look back at better days
And wish they weren‘t so far away?
I wish that I could just go back and be the way I was
I wish I‘d still not give a damn ‘bout how I come across
I wish the way I saw myself had never gotten lost
In all the worries all the thoughts
Overthinking all the parts
So exhausted, always caught up inside my doubts and flaws
And Imma count them all
Somebody catch me, I‘m ‘bout to fall
Yeah I‘m ‘bout to fall
Can we press pause?
Or do a restart
And be who we are?
We used to be the rockstars
Who never thought of no harm
‘Til this thing we call life stopped gleaming
I wish there was a way to go back dreaming
Remembering gets so hard
When time is moving so fast
Wish there was a way to know that we‘re in
The good old days before we all just leave ‘em
(We used to be the rockstars)
Didn‘t we?
(We used to be the rockstars)
Didn‘t we
Used to be the rockstars? (We used to be the rockstars)
Yeah we used to be the rockstars (We used to be the rockstars)
Remembering gets so hard
When time is moving so fast

Die Together,"I‘m in your back seat
You are driving me crazy
You‘re in full control
It‘s like you always known so
Are you having a good time
Doesn‘t seem like you‘re all fine
We don‘t laugh anymore
And when we cry we do it on our own
It‘s been a lovely year for us
Yeah that‘s what they say
It‘s been a hell of a year
And we‘ve been living in fear
Close to giving up
But if we die together now
We will always have each other
I won‘t lose you for another
And if we die together now
I will hold you till forever
If we die together die together now
I love you, say that you love me too
That‘s the only way we can get out of this hell we made
It‘s been a lovely year for us
Yeah that‘s what they say
It‘s been a hell of a year
And we‘ve been living in fear
Close to giving up
But if we die together now
We will always have each other
I won‘t lose you for another
And if we die together now
I will hold you till forever
If we die together die together now
Take my heart and rip it out
Bring it to the other side
Bring it to the other side
Take my heart and rip it out…
Cause if we die together now
We will always have each other
I won‘t lose you for another
And if we die together
I will hold you till forever
If we die together die together"
Með Hækkandi Sól,"Undercurrents sweep the heart
All but covered in deep wounds of sorrow
A deep longing burns within
Lies in hiding - come what may
- Hush hush
In the twilight you can see beautiful freedom moving closer
As the night sky drowns
The day torn by words
No one can say
- Hush hush
The darkest winter, waits for the sun
To ease away the longest nights
- with light
The darkest winter, waits for spring
To warm our embraces again
Darkness of winter closing in
Forcing every single breath they take
With growing hope for brighter days
The ice and shadows will give way
- Hush hush
The darkest winter, waits for the sun
To ease away the longest nights
- with light
The darkest winter, waits for spring
To warm our embraces again
She rises to the sky
Embracing her own power
And along the way
Finding a sense of peace
The darkest winter, waits for the sun
To ease away the longest nights
- with light
The darkest winter, waits for spring
To warm our embraces again"

Brividi,"I dreamt of flying with you
On a diamond bike
You told me you‘ve changed,
I no longer see the light in your eyes
What‘s your fear?
A deep sea where you can‘t touch
Even if sex isn‘t
The escape route from the bottom
Come on, don‘t run away from here
Don‘t leave me like this
Naked with chills
Sometimes I don‘t know how to express myself
And I‘d like to love you, but I‘m always wrong
And I‘d like to steal a pearl sky for you
And I would pay to leave,
I would also accept a lie
And I‘d like to love you, but I‘m always wrong
And I get chills, chills, chills
You, who wakes me up in the morning
You, who ruins the bed with wine
You, who bites my skin
With your viper eyes
And you, you are the opposite of an angel
And you, you are like a boxer on the corner
And you run away from here, you leave me like this
Naked with chills
Sometimes I don‘t know how to express myself
And I‘d like to love you, but I‘m always wrong
And I‘d like to steal a pearl sky for you
And I would pay to leave,
I would also accept a lie
And I‘d like to love you, but I‘m always wrong
And I get chills, chills, chills
Tell me I‘m wrong
I live inside a prison
I try to stay close to you
But I‘m sorry if I then mess it all up
I can‘t tell you what I feel, it‘s my limit
For an ‘I love you‘ I mixed drugs and tears
This poison that we spit on each other every day
I don‘t want it on anymore
You see it, I‘m here,
On a diamond bike, one among many
Naked with chills
Sometimes I don‘t know how to express myself
And I‘d like to love you, but I‘m always wrong
And I get chills, chills, chills"
Eat Your Salad,"Instead of meat I eat veggies and…
I like them both fresh, like them both juicy
I ride my bicycle to work instead of a car

Zero waste, that is my jam
Save fuel and sell your truck
The karma comes for free and so does luck

Knock knock
At night, it‘s knocking in my heart
Full of longing
A spirit,
Accompanied by memories.
You, it‘s you, it‘s you
A face seen long ago
Why are you laughing like a clown
At my glassy eyes?
Moments spinning around in my head
They‘re running back to you,
A million roses like sentiments
Drowning in a sea of clouds
Ah…
The restless sea is murmuring
There are tears in my eyes
That‘s it - he‘s never coming back
He swam through black foam
I remember standing in the middle of dunes of Nida
And waving to a seagull
So far, far away…
Moments spinning around in my head
They‘re running back to you,
A million roses like sentiments
Drowning in the sea of clouds
Moments are spinning around in my head
They‘re running back to you,
A million roses like sentiments

Trenulețul,"The train’s going, just like flying
From one country to another
It is going but confused:
What's the country? Are they fused?
Is it old or is it new?
Seems like one, but also two
Both together and apart
Are there two? Or just one part?
Hey ho, Let’s go!
Folklore and Rock ‘n’ roll.
The train’s route is East to West
Chisinau – Bucharest!
Both in that land and in this
We dance hora - it's a bliss
And in each country within
Magic's made with violin
When the train gets to a stand
Feels like almost the same land
Feels like went without a change
Home-to-home. What an exchange!
Hey ho, Let's go!
Folklore and Rock ‘n’ roll.
The train’s route is East to West
Chisinau – Bucharest!
Going quickly, going good
Train of our nationhood
But it cannot comprehend
What’s the country? Where’s the end?

Breathe,"The pain will go away they say
In the clouds foam
You‘ll keep the things to feel their smell
Just to make you warm
But nothing feels the same
The fear won‘t leave you anyway
The battle for the life
Is bigger than you know
To act so selfishly
Is unforgivable
The air is what they need
Air is what they breathe
They‘ll die without it
It‘s unforgivable
Go to sleep and dream that we
We we‘ll be reborn
Our souls will find themselves again
In the sweat of the storm
Nothing will feel the same
It‘s unforgivable
Breathe, breathe fight for your life
You better breathe
The air is what they need
Air is what they breathe
They‘ll die without it

Thought you‘d be by my side always"
Llámame,"Knew that I was different than the others
They never liked you
Trying to keep my head above the water
But you making it so hard to
What If they gonna find out
Nobody is gonna like if

Hello, my baby,
Hello, my baby,

Stripper,"He‘s a stripper
Yeah
This love is a strip club
My heart stored in a freezer
I‘m in bed with the killer
Thriller
Like a Virgin
Virgin
It‘s not a movie
London Calling
Run
I love Britney
There‘s a devil in a Birkin
What a stupid desire I have
That stupid desire
I wear the shortest skirt I have
And I go out
And I go out of my mind
I don‘t know
All I need is love
All I need is love
All I need is love
All I need is love
But what a stupid desire I have
But look at the woman I am
Nobody can judge me
Do you trust me?
What a stupid man
She‘s a Cowboy
My heart is her sex toy
She‘s my bad boy
Madonna in Playboy
She‘s a Barbie
Because she‘s got 600 HP
I‘m her Beagle
She‘s my Personal Jesus
I don‘t know
All I need is love
All I need is love
All I need is love
All I need is love
But what a stupid desire I have
But look at the woman I am
Nobody can judge me
Do you trust me?
What a stupid desire
What a stupid desire
I wear the shortest skirt that I have
And I go out
And I go out of my mind
What a stupid desire I have
(All I need is love)
Madonna, what a woman I am
(All I need is love)
Nobody can judge me
Do you trust me?
What a stupid man
I don‘t know"
In Corpore Sano,"What could be the secret of Meghan Markle‘s healthy hair?
What could it be?
I think it‘s all about the deep hydration
They say our skin and hair show it all
For example –
Deep under-eye circles could signal liver troubles
The pesky spots around the lips point to an enlarged spleen
That‘s not a good spleen, not a very pretty spleen
And the artist ought to be healthy:
To be healthy, to be healthy, to be healthy,
To be, to be, to be
To be healthy, to be healthy, to be healthy,
To be, to be, to be
How lucky, the existence of the autonomic nervous system
No need to control the heart beats
The heart beats
The heart beats, alone
A summer‘s day, the colours bright, the skirts of mine
On my body
My dog and I
We walk
Just the two of us, counting steps
The skirt steps
around my leg
We are walking
And that is all
And it does not have to get better! the heart beats by itself!
I surrender my trust, let it beat by itself!
I surrender my trust, let it beat, let me breathe!
God grant us health, grant us, grant us health!
God grant us health, since there‘s no
Medical insurance for me
Now how will they follow me?
All in the name of health
How will they care for me?
All in the name of health
The artist is invisible
All in the name of health
You can‘t see me, it‘s magical
All in the name of health
The artist could be healthy:
Be healthy, be healthy, be healthy,
be, be, be
Be healthy, be healthy, be healthy,
be, be, be
In a healthy body, in a healthy body
In a healthy body, in a healthy body
In a healthy body, in a healthy body
The body is healthy, and what now
Mensinfirm in a healthy body
A sad soul in a healthy body
Mensdesperate in a healthy body
Men frightened in a healthy body
Now what shall we do?"
Disko,"We were in a disco club
When LPS performed
Fičo was crooning
Žvižej screwed up his solo
Already I thought
That you‘re looking away too much
That look of infidelity
I knew only too well
I watch you walking away with someone else, not me
I want you, but you‘re giving your heart to another
We dance, but only in my dreams
No, you won‘t come back
I watch you walking away with someone else, not me
I want you, but you‘re giving your heart to another
We dance, but only in my dreams
No, you won‘t come back
Pictures gaze at me from the walls
They follow me everywhere
Each one brings back memories
My heart is drowning in tears
With each heartbeat, blood flows slower
You‘re still here, although you‘re no more
The scent of you wakes me up again every morning
But from now on I‘ll go to disco club on my own
And watch the same movie, without playing my part in it
I watch you walking away with someone else, not me
I want you, but you‘re giving your heart to another
We dance, but only in my dreams
No, you won‘t come back
There is no you for me anymore, I watch you walking away without me
I want you, but you‘re giving your heart to another
We dance, but only in my dreams
No, you won‘t come back"

Hold Me Closer,"No need to apologise
Cuz there‘s nothing to regret
Well this is not what I wanted
Guess all the good things come to an end
So baby bye bye, wish you the best
But most of alI I wish that I could love you less
Well maybe you‘re right, I‘ll find someone else
You say it isn‘t me but when did that ever help
Hold me closer, although you‘ll leave before the sunrise
Might be bleeding but don‘t you mind I‘ll be fine
Oh it kills me I found the right one at the wrong time
But until the sunrise
Hold tight
Hold tight
Maybe it happened to fast
I guess that I understand
You say that you‘ve never felt this way for anyone
and that‘s why it scares you to death
So baby bye bye, know It‘s for the best
Still I can‘t see how that would ease the pain in my chest
Hold me closer, although you‘ll leave before the sunrise
I‘ll be bleeding but don‘t you mind I‘ll be fine
Oh it kills me, I found the right one at the wrong time
But until the sunrise
Could you just hold me tight
I know I have to let go but just give me the night
Cuz tomorrow will hurt
hurt really bad
Cuz I‘m about to lose the best I ever had
Hold me closer, although you‘ll leave before the sunrise
I‘ll be bleeding but don‘t you mind I‘ll be fine
Oh it kills me I found the right one at the wrong time
But until the sunrise
Could you just hold me tight
I know I have to let go but just give me the night
Can‘t you see that you found the right one at the wrong time
it was just the wrong time
Hold tight
Hold tight"
Boys Do Cry,"In my room, lives a boy who could be blue,
And you might never know, oh, oh
You think he‘s cavalier, he would shed more than a crocodile tear,
If you‘d go, oh
Hearts they get broken, God only knows why,
And sometimes aeroplanes, fall down from the sky,
And mountains they crumble, and rivers they run dry,
And oh, boys do cry
When night falls, and the moon is all we see,
Don‘t fear the wolf that lives in me, oh, oh
You think he‘s tough enough, he would cry love till the sun comes up,
If you go, ooh
Hearts they get broken, God only knows why,
And sometimes aeroplanes, fall down from the sky,
And mountains they crumble, and rivers they run dry,
And oh, boys do cry,
And how they cry
And mountains they crumble,
And rivers they run dry,
And oh,
Boys do cry"
De Diepte,"Do you know the feeling
Your dream is never coming true
Do you feel afraid sometimes
Things will never change
Because everyday it‘s raining
And i can‘t see where I‘m going
You and me together, right?
It was supposed to be forever
Tadada dadadadada dada dadadadadada, Tadada dadadadadada
Oeoeo

Out here in the deep
I keep on hearing your name
Oeoeo
Aaah
Oh my dear, what am I supposed to do?
I‘m in too deep and and don‘t want to let you go
I‘m hiding under the table
And I‘m hoping you will find me
I‘ve been waiting all night long
Oh I‘m acting like a child
I‘m holding on and pulling through
And I know yo do the same
But god, what other choice do I have?
When will it be enough?
Tadada dadadadada dada dadadadadada, Tadada dadadadadada
Oeoeo

Out here in the deep
I keep on hearing your name

Stefania,"Mother Stephania Stephania mother
The field is blooming, but her hair is getting grey
Mother, sing me the lullaby
I want to hear your dear word
She was rocking me as a baby, she gave me a rhythm,
And you can‘t take willpower from me, as I got it from her
I think she knew more than King Solomon.
I‘ll always find my way home, even if all roads are destroyed
She wouldn‘t wake me up even if there was a storm outside
Or if there was a storm between her and grandma,
She trusted me over everyone else
Even when she was tired, she just kept rocking me
Lully-lully-lullaby
Mother Stephania Stephania mother
The field is blooming, but her hair is getting grey
Mother, sing me the lullaby
I want to hear your dear word
I‘m not a kid anymore, but she will always treat me like one
I‘m not a kid anymore, but she keeps worrying about me, anytime I‘m out
Mother, you are still young. If I don‘t appreciate your kindness, I‘m moving towards a dead-end
But my love for you has no end.
Mother Stephania Stephania mother
The field is blooming, but her hair is getting grey
Mother, sing me the lullaby
I want to hear your dear word"
SPACE MAN,"If I was an astronaut, I‘d be floating in mid-air
And a broken heart would just belong, to someone else down there
I would be the centre of my lonely universe
But I‘m only human, and I‘m crashing down to earth
I‘m up in space, man!
Up in space, man!
I‘ve searched around the universe
Been down some black holes
There‘s nothing but space, man!
And I wanna go home
If I was an astronaut, I‘d speak to satellites
My navigation systems would search for other life
But I‘d be up here thinking ‘bout what I left behind
‘Cause I‘m only human with the real world on my mind
I‘m up in space, man!
Up in space, man!
I‘ve searched around the universe
Been down some black holes
There‘s nothing but space, man!
And I wanna go home
Gravity keeps pulling me down
As long as you‘re on the ground, I‘ll stick around
Stick around
I‘ll stick around
I‘m up in space, man!
Up in space, man!
I‘ve searched around the universe
Been down some black holes
There‘s nothing but space, man!, no
Oh, I‘m in the wrong place, man
Nothing but, nothing but, nothing but space, man!
Nothing but, nothing but, nothing but space, man!
I‘ve searched around the universe
Been down some black holes
There‘s nothing but space, man...
And I wanna go home"
