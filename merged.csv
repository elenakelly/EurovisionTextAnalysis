(Refrain d'amour)

[Couplet 1]
Refrain, couleur du ciel
Parfum de mes vingt ans
Jardin plein de soleil
Où je courais enfant
Partout je t'ai cherché
Mon amoureux lointain
Guettant par les sentiers
Où tu prenais ma main

[Couplet 2]
Les jours s'en sont allés
Et nous avons grandi
L'amour nous a blessés
Le temps nous a guéris
Mais seule et sans printemps
Je cours en vain les bois, les champs
Dis, souviens-toi
Nos amours d'autrefois?

[Pont]
Les années passent à tire-d'aile
Et sur les toits de mon ennui
Coule la pluie
Où sont parties les caravelles
Volant mon cœur?
Portant mes rêves vers ton oubli?
J'aurais voulu que tu reviennes
Comme jadis
Porter des fleurs à ma persienne
Et ta jeunesse en mon logis

[Couplet 3]
Refrain, couleur de pluie
Regret de mes vingt ans
Chagrin, mélancolie
De n'être plus enfant
Mais seule et loin de toi
Par les chemins où tu n'es pas
Je vais, pleurant
Mes amours de vingt ans","Chorus of love, or or or or
Chorus, color of the sky, fragrance of my twenties
Garden full of sunshine where I ran as a child
Everywhere, I was looking for you, my distant love
By watching the paths where you took my hand The days are gone and we have grown
Love hurt us, time healed us
But only and without spring
I run in vain, in the woods, the fields
Telling me to remember you, our love of another time The years pass, take wings
And on the roofs of my boredom, the rain flows
Where the caravel parties are
Driving my heart, supporting my dreams of your oblivion
I would agree you return like before
Take flowers in my blinds
And your youth in my home Chorus, color of the rain, regrets of my twenties
Grief, melancholy of no longer being a child
But only and far from you, by the paths where you are not
I'm mourning my love of twenty years"

 Don’t yawn from sleep or boredom

Am I still that woman
 With whom you once – when was it again?
 Wanted to have that little adventure at all costs? Be nice once again, just like then
 Ask me once again for a kiss
 Bring me roses again, blush again
 When you see me, just like then Be nice and gallant once again
 Find me beautiful and charming again
 Then the world will be just like before
 A fairyland Yes, you’re getting fat and your hair is turning grey
 But you still can flirt, believe me
 Ah, sometimes you act like a child, so silly
 Gruff and wanton by turn Do you remember? Do you remember? Don’t say no now
 Do you remember, that you said then?
 The happiest couple, that’s the both of us
 My love, dearest darling, never ends Be nice once again, just like then
 Ask me once again for a kiss

In een klein cafeetje
En slenteren in de maneschijn

""Ik zweer je eeuwig trouw""

Ook geen deur heeft

And that I could look in the little interior
Then you had to be sincere, good or bad, but true
And then you'd soon say, when I asked: ""Are you faithful?"" A bit, everyone is in love at least once, you know that
You want to be sensible, but you forget that
As soon as you listen to what Amor whispers
Then you know, it will be something like Faust and Gretchen
With little rendezvous in a little café
And strolling in the moonshine With the smell of roses
And kissing goodbye at the door
The night is blue, you whisper mouth to mouth
I swear eternal allegiance to you A bit, you were in love more than once, mister, you know that
Your heart came up with a little idea more than once
You were sorry, but ah you know, sometimes you forget
Maybe a bit too soon, your little oath of loyalty But actually, I'm happy that my heart has no door either
Because you never know what may live there in the interior
I'm willing to promise, when we get engaged
And you ask: ""Are you faithful?"", I'll never say to you... With the smell of roses
And kissing goodbye at the door
The night is blue, you whisper mouth to mouth
I swear eternal allegiance to you A bit, you were in love more than once, mister, you know that
Your heart came up with a little idea more than once
You were sorry, but ah you know, sometimes you forget

Nous les amoureux
On voudrait nous séparer
On voudrait nous empêcher
D'être heureux
Nous les amoureux
Il paraît que c'est l'enfer
Qui nous guette
Ou bien le fer
Et le feu
C'est vrai, les imbéciles et les méchants
Nous font du mal, nous jouent des tours
Pourtant rien n'est plus évident
Que l'amour
Nous les amoureux
Nous ne pouvons rien contre eux
Ils sont mille et l'on est deux
Mais l'heure va sonner
Des nuis moins difficiles
Et je pourrai t'aimer
Sans qu'on en parle en ville
C'est promis
C'est écrit
Nous les amoureux
Le soleil brille pour nous
Et l'on dort sur les genoux
Du bon Dieu
Nous les amoureux
Il nous a donné le droit
Au bonheur et à la joie
D'être deux
Alors, les sans-amour, les mal-aimés
Il faudra bien nous acquitter
Vous qui n'avez jamais été
Condamnés
Nous les amoureux
Nous allons vivre sans vous
Car le ciel est avec nous
Les amoureux","We, the lovers – they want to separate us
They would like to prevent us from being happy
We, the lovers – it seems that it’s hell
That watches us or else the iron and the fire
It’s true, the idiots and the evil ones
Harm us, do bad things to us
However nothing is more obvious than love
We, the lovers, we can do nothing against them
They are a thousand and we are two, the lovers But the hour is going to ring on the least difficult nights
And I could love you without them talking about it downtown
It’s promised, it’s written down We, the lovers – the sun shines for us
And we sleep on the knees of the Good Lord
We, the lovers – He gave us the right
To be happy and to be joyful together Then, the without-loves, the mis-loved
It will be necessary that we pay back
Those who have never been condemned
We, the lovers, we’re going to live without you
For the sky is with us, the lovers"

But the child that we are, the child that we remained
Will always hum in memory of this love And you, you that I loved
What did you make of yourself?
What did you do without me?
And me, me who lost you
What have I done more?
Was I so much more lucky?
Did we actually know..... A first love, first love, first love
Is never forgotten, never forgotten, never forgotten

Like a puppet on a
String","[Chorus]
I wonder if one day that
You'll say that you care
If you say you love me madly
I'll gladly be there
Like a puppet on a string

[Verse 1]
Love is just like a merry-go-round
With all the fun of a fair
One day I'm feeling down on the ground
Then I'm up in the air
Are you leading me on?
Tomorrow will you be gone?

[Chorus]
I wonder if one day that
You'll say that you care
If you say you love me madly
I'll gladly be there
Like a puppet on a string

[Verse 2]
I may win on the roundabout
Then I'll lose on the swings
In or out, there is never a doubt
Just who's pulling the strings
I'm all tied up in you
But where's it leading me to?

[Chorus]
I wonder if one day that
You'll say that you care
If you say you love me madly
I'll gladly be there
Like a puppet on a string
I wonder if one day that
You'll say that you care
If you say you love me madly
I'll gladly be there
Like a puppet on a string

Maar ook het werkvolk uit de schuur
Hoorde zijn lied vol avontuur
Hoorde bij 't nacht'lijk keukenvuur

Van vrouwen in fluweel of grijs

De troubadour
Hij zong voor boeren op 't land
Een kerelslied van eigen hand
Hij was van elke rang en stand
De troubadour, de troubadour
Zo zong hij heel zijn leven lang
Zijn eigen lied, zijn eigen zang
Toch gaat de dood gewoon zijn gang

Vergeet hem niet

A long and bloody story,
The troubadour But also the workers from the shed,
Heard his song of adventure,
Belonged to the nightly kitchen fire,
The troubadour, the troubadour And at the inn of the city,
He sang a drinking song in the wet,

Of a miracle that happened,
Even if no one sees the miracle,
The troubadour Of women in velvet or in gray,
He made the hearts confused,
His love song went along for the trip,
The troubadour He sang for farmes on the land,
A dude song of his own,
He was in every walk of life,
The troubadour, the troubadour So he sang for all his life,
His own song, his own voice,
Yet the death goes his own way,
The troubadour, the troubadour Then it became quiet, the song was over,
Only some mud remains,
But who was comforted by his song,
Will remember him, Cause he was so full of music,

Over three branches of lilacs
That a child will behold
Just like a picture book The world around him
Will be empty, and so
He'll imagine life
From a blank page By drawing the shape of an orange
He'll give the sky its first sun
By drawing the bird
He'll invent the flowers
By searching the sound of the water
He'll hear the cry of the heart By drawing the points of a star
This very child will find the path
Of the grown people who still
Look amazed
At the fruits of every day
And at the roses of love"

Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Won't you save them for me even though you're only three","[Verse 1]
Though it hurts to go away, it's impossible to stay
But there's one thing I must say before I go
I love you (I love you), you know
I'll be thinking of you in most everything I do
Now the time is moving on and I really should be gone
But you keep me hanging on for one more smile
I love you (I love you), all the while
With your cute little way will you promise that you'll save

[Chorus]
Your kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Gonna walk out the door
But I'll soon be back for more
Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
So long, honey, so long
Hang on, baby, hang on
Don't you dare me to stay
'Cause you know I'll have to say

[Verse 2]
That I've got to work each day and that's why I go away
But I count the seconds 'til I'm home with you
I love you (I love you), it's true
You're so cute, honey gee, won't you save them up for me

[Chorus]
Your kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Gonna walk out the door
But I'll soon be back for more
Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
So long, honey, so long
Hang on, baby, hang on
Don't you dare me to stay
'Cause you know you've got to save
Your kisses for me, save all your kisses for me

Comme l'oiseau bleu survolant la terre

Beau le bateau dansant sur les vagues
Ivre de vie, d'amour et de vent
Belle la chanson, naissante des vagues
Abandonnée au sable blanc

Blanc l'innocent, le sang du poète
Qui en chantant invente l'amour
Pour que la vie s'habille de fête
Et que la nuit se change en jour

Jour d'une vie ou l'aube se lève
Pour réveiller la ville aux yeux lourds
Où les matins effeuillent les rêves
Pour nous donner un monde d'amour

Toi mon étoile qui tisse ma ronde
Viens allumer mon soleil noir

Noir la misère,les hommes et la guerre
Qui croient tenir les rènes du temps
Pays d'amour n'a pas de frontières
Pour ceux qui ont un coeur d'enfant

Who sees birds flying away
Like the blue bird flying over the earth
See how the world, the world is beautiful. Beautiful the boat with dance on vogues
Drunk of life, of love and of wind
Beautiful the song of emerging vogues
Deserted with white sand White the innocent, the blood of the poet
Who invent the love while singing
So that the life dress up party
And that the night turns into day Day of a life where the dawn is rising
To wake up the city with heavy eyes
Where mornings flakes the dreams
To give us a world of love Love is you, love is me
The bird is you, the child is me. I am just a girl of shade
Who sees shine the evening star
You my star who weaves my round
Come turn on my black sun Black the misery, the humans and the war
Who believe that they hold the reins of time
Country of love do not have borders
For those who have a child heart Like a childwith light in the eyes
Who sees birds flying away
Like the blue bird flying over the earth
See how the world, how the world is beautiful Love is you, love is me
The bird is you, the child is me
The bird is you, the child is me."

A little bit of warmth, is what I'm whishing for.

Jag har aldrig slutat tro
Att efter varje natt väntar gryningen
Fast jag inte kan förstå
Så finns det tid för skratt när jag börjar om igen
Känner doften från en stilla ocean
Plötsligt står jag i en levande orkan

[Refräng]
Jag är fångad av en stormvind
Fast för dig
Ingenting kan hindra mig
När det blåser i mitt hjärta
Fångad av en stormvind, natt och dag
Här finns bara du och jag
Och det ljus som himlen lämnat kvar

[Vers 2]
Det är dags att ge sig av
För stunder som har flytt kommer aldrig mer
Reser ut på öppet hav
Där allting blir som nytt
I den framtid som du ger
Utan saknad lämnar jag min trygga hamn
Fri, men ändå bunden till en öppen famn

[Refräng]
Jag är fångad av en stormvind
Fast för dig
Ingenting kan hindra mig
När det blåser i mitt hjärta
Fångad av en stormvind, natt och dag

Vi går tillsammans
Förenad av kärlekens band

När du ler och räcker mig din hand

Woh-ho-ho-oh I have never stopped believing
That after every night a new dawn waits
Though I can not understand
There is time for laugher as I begin once again Feeling the smell of a silent ocean
And suddenly I'm standing in the middle of a windstorm I am captured by a windstorm
Caught on you
Nothing here can stop me
When it's windy in my heart
Captured by a windstorm
Night and day
Here is only you and me
And the light the sky has left behind It's time to leave
Because times that have pass will not return
Traveling on open seas
Where everything's like new
In the future that you hold Without regrets I leave my safe harbor
Free but still tied to a set of open arms I am captured by a windstorm
Caught on you
Nothing here can stop me
When it's windy in my heart
Captured by a windstorm
Night and day
Here is only you and me
And the light the sky has left behind We walk together
Joined by the ribbons of love
My longing wakes
When you smile, and reacher out your hand I am captured by a windstorm
Captured by a windstorm
(Caught for you)
Nothing here can stop me
When it's windy in my heart
Captured by a windstorm
Night and day
Here is only you and me

Hold on to a dream
Take me to your heaven
When my nights are cold and lonely
Flying high together
On a journey to the stars
Won't you take me to your heaven, to your heart

[Verse 2]
I can feel your body next to mine
Reaching for a kiss that keeps me warm and tender
Seven steps to heaven, show the way
When I'm there I give myself the sweet surrender

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I gonna make you mine
Love you till the end of time

[Chorus]
Take me to your heaven
Hold on to a dream
Take me to your heaven
When my nights are cold and lonely
Flying high together
On a journey to the stars
Won't you take me to your heaven, to your heart

[Bridge]
As dawn is breaking, there is so much more to say
So will you be my one and only
When nights are lonely
Hold on time forever

[Chorus]
Take me to your heaven
Hold on to a dream
Take me to your heaven
When my nights are cold and lonely
Flying high together
On a journey to the stars
Won't you take me to your heaven, to your heart

Won't you take me to your heaven, to your heart"

’Cause I don’t care if I lose my mind
I’m already cursed

[Verse 2]
Every day, we started fighting
Every night, we fell in love
No one else could make me sadder
But no one else could lift me high above
I don’t know what I was doing
When suddenly, we fell apart
Nowadays, I cannot find her
But when I do, we’ll get a brand-new start

[Chorus 1]
I’m in love with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
’Cause I don’t care if I lose my mind
I’m already cursed

[Chorus 2]
She’s a fairytale, yeah
Even though it hurts
’Cause I don’t care if I lose my mind
I’m already cursed"

[Verso 1]
Se um dia alguém perguntar por mim
Diz que vivi para te amar
Antes de ti só existi
Cansado e sem nada para dar

[Refrão]
Meu bem, ouve as minhas preces
Peço que regresses, que me voltes a querer
Eu sei que não se ama sozinho
Talvez devagarinho possas voltar a aprender

[Refrão]
Meu bem, ouve as minhas preces
Peço que regresses, que me voltes a querer
Eu sei que não se ama sozinho
Talvez devagarinho possas voltar a aprender

[Verso 2]
Se o teu coração não quiser ceder
Não sentir paixão, não quiser sofrer
Sem fazer planos do que virá depois
O meu coração pode amar pelos dois","If one day someone asks about me
Say that I lived just to love you
Before you, I only existed
Tired and without a thing to offer My dear, listen to my prayers
I ask you to come back, that you come back to love me
I know we can't love alone
Maybe little by little you can learn again My dear, listen to my prayers
I ask you to come back, that you come back to love me
I know we can't love alone
Maybe little by little you can learn again If your heart doesn't wish to do so
To feel the passion, If it doesn't want to suffer
Without making plans about what will happen
My Heart can love for the both of us"

[Verse 1]
A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

[Pre-Chorus]
I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

[Verse 2]
How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on

Ooh, ooh

Loving you is a losing game

Get me off this rollercoaster
