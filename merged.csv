Song,English Lyrics
Refrain,"Chorus of love, or or or or
Chorus, color of the sky, fragrance of my twenties
Garden full of sunshine where I ran as a child
Everywhere, I was looking for you, my distant love
By watching the paths where you took my hand The days are gone and we have grown
Love hurt us, time healed us
But only and without spring
I run in vain, in the woods, the fields
Telling me to remember you, our love of another time The years pass, take wings
And on the roofs of my boredom, the rain flows
Where the caravel parties are
Driving my heart, supporting my dreams of your oblivion
I would agree you return like before
Take flowers in my blinds
And your youth in my home Chorus, color of the rain, regrets of my twenties
Grief, melancholy of no longer being a child
But only and far from you, by the paths where you are not
I'm mourning my love of twenty years"
Net als toen,"Don’t be so drowsy with that eternal paper
 Don’t yawn from sleep or boredom
 I’m your wife and I eat out of your hand
 But I don’t eat from charity Don’t look at me as if you think, “are you still alive?”
Am I still that woman
 With whom you once – when was it again?
 Wanted to have that little adventure at all costs? Be nice once again, just like then
 Ask me once again for a kiss
 Bring me roses again, blush again
 When you see me, just like then Be nice and gallant once again
 Find me beautiful and charming again
 Then the world will be just like before
 A fairyland Yes, you’re getting fat and your hair is turning grey
 But you still can flirt, believe me
 Ah, sometimes you act like a child, so silly
 Gruff and wanton by turn Do you remember? Do you remember? Don’t say no now
 Do you remember, that you said then?
 The happiest couple, that’s the both of us
 My love, dearest darling, never ends Be nice once again, just like then
 Ask me once again for a kiss
 Bring me roses again, blush again
 When you see me, just like then Be nice and gallant once again
 Find me beautiful and charming again
 Then the world will be just like before
 A fairyland"
"Dors, mon amour","Sleep, my love
 The sun is still far from the day
 We have all the time to love
 And the night understands us Sleep, my love
 Protected by my arms that surround
 Your sleep with a curtain of happiness
 Sleep onto my heart I’m a king
 That holds his whole kingdom in his fingers
 And that shivers of seeing fall down
 This enchanted kingdom Sleep, my love
 My princess, locked up in her tower
 With all the refrains of the night
 My sleepy princess I’m following your soul step by step on its way of joy
 And I amuse myself by leaning over your starry sleep Sleep, my love
 The sun is still far from the day
 We have all the time to love
 And the night understands us Sleep, my love
 Protected by my arms that surround
 Your sleep with a curtain of happiness
 Sleep onto my heart I hear the voice
 Of your life that beats so close to me
 And I feel like a very gentle blow
 That caresses my cheek Sleep, my love
 My princess, locked up in her tower
 I see the morning smile
 Here’s the sun of tomorrow
 The great sun of the eternal love"
Een beetje,"I wanted your heart to be a closet with a little door
And that I could look in the little interior
Then you had to be sincere, good or bad, but true
And then you'd soon say, when I asked: ""Are you faithful?"" A bit, everyone is in love at least once, you know that
You want to be sensible, but you forget that
As soon as you listen to what Amor whispers
Then you know, it will be something like Faust and Gretchen
With little rendezvous in a little café
And strolling in the moonshine With the smell of roses
And kissing goodbye at the door
The night is blue, you whisper mouth to mouth
I swear eternal allegiance to you A bit, you were in love more than once, mister, you know that
Your heart came up with a little idea more than once
You were sorry, but ah you know, sometimes you forget
Maybe a bit too soon, your little oath of loyalty But actually, I'm happy that my heart has no door either
Because you never know what may live there in the interior
I'm willing to promise, when we get engaged
And you ask: ""Are you faithful?"", I'll never say to you... With the smell of roses
And kissing goodbye at the door
The night is blue, you whisper mouth to mouth
I swear eternal allegiance to you A bit, you were in love more than once, mister, you know that
Your heart came up with a little idea more than once
You were sorry, but ah you know, sometimes you forget
Maybe a bit too soon, your little oath of loyalty"
Tom Pillibi,"Tom Pillibi
Tom Pillibi has two castles – the first one in Scotland
Tom Pillibi has two castles – the other one in Montenegro
He also has two ships which go to the end of the world
To search for gold and corals and the most beautiful jewels
He's lucky – Tom Pillibi
And I think that I'm his girlfriend
He's so rich, that I envy him
He's so rich – blasted Tom Pillibi
Tom Pillibi has two secrets, which he won't tell anyone
Tom Pillibi has two secrets – I'm the only one who knows them
The king's daughter smiles to him and waits for him in her bedroom
The king's daughter smiles to him and the shepherdess too
He's lucky – Tom Pillibi
And I think that I'm his girlfriend
Which good star is looking after him?
Which good star? – Blasted Tom Pillibi
Tom Pillibi has only one fault, but it's nothing serious
Tom Pillibi has only one fault, but it's not such a big thing
He's charming, he's kind-hearted, he has so much courage
He's charming, he's kind-hearted, but he's such a liar
Because nothing exists of all that
But I don't care when I'm in his arms
Because I'm the queen of the big country
Where he takes me to – blasted Tom Pillibi"
Nous les amoureux,"We, the lovers – they want to separate us
They would like to prevent us from being happy
We, the lovers – it seems that it’s hell
That watches us or else the iron and the fire
It’s true, the idiots and the evil ones
Harm us, do bad things to us
However nothing is more obvious than love
We, the lovers, we can do nothing against them
They are a thousand and we are two, the lovers But the hour is going to ring on the least difficult nights
And I could love you without them talking about it downtown
It’s promised, it’s written down We, the lovers – the sun shines for us
And we sleep on the knees of the Good Lord
We, the lovers – He gave us the right
To be happy and to be joyful together Then, the without-loves, the mis-loved
It will be necessary that we pay back
Those who have never been condemned
We, the lovers, we’re going to live without you
For the sky is with us, the lovers"
Un premier amour,"A first love, first love, first love
Is never forgotten, never forgotten, never forgotten
A first love, we always look for it
In other loves, we pursue it our whole life It confused us and made us dream and made us tremble
This first love, first love, first love
But the child that we are, the child that we remained
Will always hum in memory of this love And you, you that I loved
What did you make of yourself?
What did you do without me?
And me, me who lost you
What have I done more?
Was I so much more lucky?
Did we actually know..... A first love, first love, first love
Is never forgotten, never forgotten, never forgotten
A first love, we always look for it
In other loves, we pursue it our whole life That all these kisses that we have stolen rather than given
These innocent gestures engaged us for so long
No, the children we still were back then
Didn't suspect much, they were delighted
That a first love, their first love was so strong"
Dansevise,"A ray of sunshine in a puddle
A little kiss on the cheek from a wind
And the rush, humming
That life's beginning
It's a web in your mind A whistle of silver from a treetop
A faint sound of a cat grabbing
A ripple in the stream
A whisper in the hedge
That says, that it isn't night anymore The meadow is wet with dew
Lady Dawn goes to bed
Day gets up playfully
And crossing the bridge of the sun And the two of us?
What about the two of us?
Yes, what about the two of us, you and me?
I'm dancing and dancing and stopping
And sensing only you
Why ever did you run away? Come back, come back
Come back, you my beloved friend
Come back, come back
Wherever you wish, are we dancing to Come, let us dance
Everything can happen
Come, let us dance
Let us dance, let us laugh A whistle of silver from a treetop
A faint sound of a cat grabbing
A ripple in the stream
A whisper in the hedge
That says, that it isn't night anymore The meadow is wet with dew
Lady Dawn goes to bed
Day gets up playfully
And crossing the bridge of the sun And the two of us?
What about the two of us?
Yes, what about the two of us, you and me?
I'm dancing and dancing and stopping
And sensing only you
Why ever did you run away?
Come back, come back Beloved friend"
Non ho l'età,"I am young,
I am young to love you.
I am young to go out only with you. And it would be not necessary
It would be not necessary
To tell you anything
Because you know too much about me. Let me live
With a romantic love
In waiting
That that day will come
But not now. I am young,
I am young to love you.
I am young to go out only with you. If you wanted,
If you wanted
To wait for me.
You will have that day,
All my love for you. Let me live
With a romantic love
In waiting
That that day will come
But not now. If you wanted,
If you wanted
To wait for me.
You will have that day,
All my love for you."
"Poupée de cire, poupée de son","I'm a wax doll
A sound doll
My heart is engraved in my songs
Wax doll, sound doll Am I better, am I worse
Than a fashion doll ?
It's like I see life through bright rosy-tinted glasses
Wax doll, sound doll My records are a mirror
In which everyone can see me
I'm everywhere in the same time
Broken in a thousand pieces of voice Around me I can hear
Rag dolls laughing
Those who dance to my songs
Wax doll, sound doll They let themselves be seduced
For any old reason
Love isn't only in songs
Wax doll, sound doll My records are a mirror
In which everyone can see me
I'm everywhere in the same time
Broken in a thousand pieces of voice Alone, I sometimes sigh
Thinking, what's the point
Of singing love like this, without reason
Without knowing anything about boys? I'm only a wax doll
Only a sound doll
Under my sunny blond hair
Wax doll, sound doll But one day I'll be living my songs
Wax doll, sound doll
Without fearing boys' warmth
Wax doll, sound doll"
"Merci, Chérie","Thank you, thank you, thank you
For the hours, darling, darling, darling
Our love was beautiful, so beautiful, thank you, darling
Don't be sad, even though I have to leave you Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Your tears hurt, hurt so much, so much
Our dream flies away, away, thank you, darling
Don't cry, even this does make some sense Look ahead, don't look back, you can't force destiny
Because no sea is as wild as love
Only love can be like this
Can be like this, like this Thank you, thank you, thank you
For the hours, darling, darling, darling
Our love was beautiful, so beautiful, thank you, darling So beautiful, so beautiful, thank you, darling
So beautiful, so beautiful, thank you, darling"
Puppet on a String,"[Chorus]
I wonder if one day that
You'll say that you care
If you say you love me madly
I'll gladly be there
Like a puppet on a string

[Verse 1]
Love is just like a merry-go-round
With all the fun of a fair
One day I'm feeling down on the ground
Then I'm up in the air
Are you leading me on?
Tomorrow will you be gone?

[Chorus]
I wonder if one day that
You'll say that you care
If you say you love me madly
I'll gladly be there
Like a puppet on a string

[Verse 2]
I may win on the roundabout
Then I'll lose on the swings
In or out, there is never a doubt
Just who's pulling the strings
I'm all tied up in you
But where's it leading me to?

[Chorus]
I wonder if one day that
You'll say that you care
If you say you love me madly
I'll gladly be there
Like a puppet on a string
I wonder if one day that
You'll say that you care
If you say you love me madly
I'll gladly be there
Like a puppet on a string

[Outro]
Like a puppet on a
String"
"La, la, la","La la la la la la la la la la... I sing in the morning

La la la la la la la la...

Vivo cantando,"(Pa para para papa...)
(Pa para para papa...) How many nights I wandered
Through a thousand endless paths?
How many nights I kept silent
About what I wanted to say?
A deep hope
And a faraway echo was talking about you Today that you came to my life
I only sing for you Since you arrived, I don't live by crying
I live by singing, I live by dreaming
I just want you to tell me what's happening
Because I'm trembling when I'm by your side Since you arrived, I don't live by crying (hey)
I live by singing (hey), I live by dreaming (hey)
But I wonder how long I could keep
Your love deep inside of me (Pa para para papa...)
(Pa para para papa...) Since you arrived, I don't live by crying (hey)
I live by singing (hey), I live by dreaming (hey)
I just want you to tell me what's happening
Because I'm trembling when I'm by your side Since you arrived, I don't live by crying (hey)
I live by singing (hey), I live by dreaming (hey)
But I wonder how long I could keep
Your love deep inside of me Since you arrived, I don't live by crying (hey)
I live by singing (hey), I live by dreaming (hey)
I just want you to tell me what's happening
Because I'm trembling when I'm by your side
Because I'm trembling when I'm by your side (Pa para para papa...)
(Pa para para papa...) Hey, hey!"

De troubadour,"He was so full of music,
He sang for big and small audiences,
He made you happy, melancholy,
The troubadour For knights in the high hall,
He sang in though, strong language,
A long and bloody story,
The troubadour But also the workers from the shed,
Heard his song of adventure,
Belonged to the nightly kitchen fire,
The troubadour, the troubadour And at the inn of the city,
He sang a drinking song in the wet,
For who still could stand and who sat,
The troubadour, the troubadour La, la, la, la, la, la, lei, la, la, lei, la, la
La, la, la, lei, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, lei, la, la, lei, la, la
La, la, la, lei, la, la, la He sang his song quiet in the monastry,
Of a miracle that happened,
Even if no one sees the miracle,
The troubadour Of women in velvet or in gray,
He made the hearts confused,
His love song went along for the trip,
The troubadour He sang for farmes on the land,
A dude song of his own,
He was in every walk of life,
The troubadour, the troubadour So he sang for all his life,
His own song, his own voice,
Yet the death goes his own way,
The troubadour, the troubadour Then it became quiet, the song was over,
Only some mud remains,
But who was comforted by his song,
Will remember him, Cause he was so full of music,
He sang for large and small audiences,
He made you happy, melancholy,
The troubadour La, la, la, la, la, la, lei, la, la, lei, la, la

"Un jour, un enfant","A day will dawn
Over three branches of lilacs
That a child will behold
Just like a picture book The world around him
Will be empty, and so
He'll imagine life
From a blank page By drawing the shape of an orange
He'll give the sky its first sun
By drawing the bird
He'll invent the flowers
By searching the sound of the water
He'll hear the cry of the heart By drawing the points of a star
This very child will find the path
Of the grown people who still
Look amazed
At the fruits of every day
And at the roses of love"
All Kinds of Everything,"Snowdrops and daffodils
Butterflies and bees
Sailboats and fishermen
Things of the sea
Wishing-wells
Wedding bells
Early morning dew
All kinds of everything remind me of you

Seagulls and aeroplanes
Things of the sky
Winds that go howlin'
Breezes that sigh
City sights
Neon lights
Grey skies or blue
All kinds of everything remind me of you

Summertime
Wintertime
Spring and autumn too
Monday
Tuesday every day
I think of you
Dances
Romances
Things of the night
Sunshine and holidays
Postcards to write
Budding trees
Autumn leaves
A snowflake or two

"Un banc, un arbre, une rue","We all have a bench, a tree, a street
Where we cherished our dreams
We all have a bench, a tree, a street
A childhood that has been too short One day or another we have to leave
To build a future, a future
And it's the unforgettable instant
When we return our child clothes, child clothes Everyone goes, filled with hope
On the road that they chose, that they chose
To the richness or to the glory
Yet what our life will be, our life We all have a bench, a tree, a street
Where we cherished our dreams
We all have a bench, a tree, a street
A childhood that has been too short Everyone, in his corner of the horizon
Only defends their ambitions, their ambitions
But if we share nothing
What will be left for us in common, in common? We all have a bench, a tree, a street
Where we cherished our dreams
We all have a bench, a tree, a street
A childhood that has been too short Lalala lala...

Après toi,"You go, in you
Love has for you
The smile of another
I would like but cannot want in you.
From now on,
You have my help
This is not your fault
But,  however, you must know That after you
I will not be able to live anymore, to live no more
That in remembering you
After you,
I will have wet eyes
The empty hands, the heart without joy.
With you,
I had learned how to laugh
And my laughter comes only by you.
After you, I will be only a shadow...
Of your shadow....
After you... Even a day, if I make my life,
If I hold the promise
Who links two beings (perhaps) forever
After you
I might be able
To give my tenderness
But not my love After you
I will not be able to live anymore, to live no more
That in remembering you
After you,
I will have wet eyes
The empty hands, the heart without joy.
With you,
I had learned how to laugh
And my laughter comes only by you.
After you, I will be only a shadow...
Of your shadow....
After you..."
Tu te reconnaîtras,"In childhood dreams
In the student whom the master punished
In the station where
The first adventure of your life begins In those who doubt
In those who believe You'll see, you'll recognize yourself
At every moment in every joy, every tear
You'll see, you'll recognize yourself
In this child, among these people, as you all In the dreams of the artist
Whom glory has never crowned
In this selfish world
Who denies that which he loved In those who fear
In those who are cold You will see, you will recognize yourself
At every moment, in every joy, in every tear
You will see, you will recognize yourself
In this child, among these people, all like you You will see, you will recognize yourself
In this love I have for you
Yes, you will see, you will recognize yourself"
Waterloo,"[Verse 1]
My, my - at Waterloo, Napoleon did surrender
Oh, yeah - and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way

[Pre-Chorus]
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself

[Chorus]
Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore

Finally facing my Waterloo

[Verse 2]
My, my - I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger
Oh, yeah - and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight

And how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo

Save Your Kisses for Me,"[Verse 1]
Though it hurts to go away, it's impossible to stay
But there's one thing I must say before I go
I love you (I love you), you know
I'll be thinking of you in most everything I do
Now the time is moving on and I really should be gone
But you keep me hanging on for one more smile
I love you (I love you), all the while
With your cute little way will you promise that you'll save

[Chorus]
Your kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Gonna walk out the door
But I'll soon be back for more
Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
So long, honey, so long
Hang on, baby, hang on
Don't you dare me to stay
'Cause you know I'll have to say

[Verse 2]
That I've got to work each day and that's why I go away
But I count the seconds 'til I'm home with you
I love you (I love you), it's true
You're so cute, honey gee, won't you save them up for me

[Chorus]
Your kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Gonna walk out the door
But I'll soon be back for more
Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
So long, honey, so long
Hang on, baby, hang on
Don't you dare me to stay
'Cause you know you've got to save
Your kisses for me, save all your kisses for me
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Don't cry, honey, don't cry
Won't you save them for me even though you're only three"
L'oiseau et l'enfant,"Like a child with light in the eyes
Who sees birds flying away
Like the blue bird flying over the earth
See how the world, the world is beautiful. Beautiful the boat with dance on vogues
Drunk of life, of love and of wind
Beautiful the song of emerging vogues
Deserted with white sand White the innocent, the blood of the poet
Who invent the love while singing
So that the life dress up party
And that the night turns into day Day of a life where the dawn is rising
To wake up the city with heavy eyes
Where mornings flakes the dreams
To give us a world of love Love is you, love is me
The bird is you, the child is me. I am just a girl of shade
Who sees shine the evening star
You my star who weaves my round
Come turn on my black sun Black the misery, the humans and the war
Who believe that they hold the reins of time
Country of love do not have borders
For those who have a child heart Like a childwith light in the eyes
Who sees birds flying away
Like the blue bird flying over the earth
See how the world, how the world is beautiful Love is you, love is me
The bird is you, the child is me
The bird is you, the child is me."
Hallelujah (הללויה),"Hallelujah to the world,
Everybody will sing hallelujah.
With one single word,
The heart is full with a lot of thanks,
and beats itself as well - what a wonderful world. Hallelujah with the song,
Hallelujah for a day that shines.
Hallelujah for what has already happened,
And on what has yet to happen,
Hallelujah. Hallelujah to the world,
Everynody will sing hallelujah.
And the big clappers
will echo in many sounds,
and they'll say, with us, hallelujah. Hallelujah with the song,
Hallelujah for a day that shines.
Hallelujah for what has already happened,
And on what has yet to happen,
Hallelujah. Hallelujah for everything,
Hallelujah for tomorrow and yesterday,
and sing from one heart -
Hallelujah."
What's Another Year,"I've been waiting such a long time
Looking out for you
But you're not here
What's another year?

I've been waking such a long time
Reaching out for you
But you're not near
What's another year?

What's another year
To someone who's lost everything that he owns?
What's another year
To someone who's getting used to being alone?

I've been praying such a long time
It's the only way to hide the fear
What's another year?

What's another year
To someone who's lost everything that he owns?
What's another year
To someone who's getting used to being alone?

I've been crying such a long time
With such a lot of pain in every tear

What's another year?
To someone who is getting used to being alone
What's another year?
For someone who is getting used to being alone
What's another year?
To someone who is getting used to being alone"
Making Your Mind Up,"[Chorus]
You gotta speed it up and then you gotta slow it down
'Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top you gotta play around
But soon you will find that there comes a time
For making your mind up

[Verse 1]
You gotta turn it on and then you gotta put it out
You gotta be sure that it's something everybody's gonna talk about
Before you decide that the times arrived
For making your mind up

[Refrain]
Don't let your indecision take you from behind
Trust your inner vision
Don't let others change your mind

[Verse 2]
And then you really gotta burn it up and make another fly by night
Get a run for your money and take a chance and it'll turn out right
And when you can see how it's gotta be
You're making your mind up

[Verse 3]
And try to look as if you don't care less but if you want to see some more
Bending the rules of the game will let you find the one you're looking for
And then you can show that you think you know
You're making your mind up

[Refrain]
Don't let your indecision, take you from behind
Trust your inner vision
Don't let others change your mind

[Chorus]
You gotta speed it up and then you gotta slow it down
'Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top you gotta play around
But soon you will find that there comes a time
For making your mind up
You gotta speed it up and then you gotta slow it down
'Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top you gotta play around
But soon you will find that there comes a time
For making your mind up
For making your mind up
For making your mind up
For making your mind up"
Ein bißchen Frieden,"Like a flower at the beginning of winter
and like a fire in an icy wind.
Like a doll, no one loves anymore,
this is how i feel on some days.
Then I see the clouds, above me and you
and hear the cries of the birds in the wind
I'm singing because I'm afraid of the dark
and hope that nothing's going to happen. A little bit of peace, a little bit of sun
on this earth, we all live on.
A little bit of peace, a little bit of happiness,
A little bit of warmth, is what I'm whishing for.
A little bit of peace, a little bit of dreaming
and that the people don't cry so often.
A little bit of peace, a little bit of love,
that I'll never lose hope again. I know that my songs, won't change so many things
I am just a girl, who says what she feels
alone I am helpless, a bird in the wind
who feels that a storm is brewing. A little bit of peace, a little bit of sun
on this earth, we all live on.
A little bit of peace, a little bit of happiness,
A little bit of warmth, is what I'm whishing for.
A little bit of peace, a little bit of dreaming
and that the people don't cry so often.
A little bit of peace, a little bit of love,
that I'll never lose hope again. Sing with me a little song,
that the world lives in peace.
Sing with me a little song,
that the world lives in peace"
Si la vie est cadeau,"Us, it was all blue
A summer sky, a transparent ocean
We, we were two
and we loved each other strong enough to stop time But time has cheated on us
So, why having promised me the entire world?
Our love would have been enough
I didn't want imaginary happiness
If life is a gift If life is a gift
Given present, taken back gift, stolen present
Take love as a gift
Given present, taken back gift, stolen present
Happiness is too short Us, it was the child I wanted badly
To offer you in Spring But time has got all the rights
So, why having promised me the entire world?
And the child that is not there?
Now it is my only  imaginary happiness
If life is a gift If life is a gift
Given present, taken back gift, stolen present
Take love as a gift
Given present, taken back gift, stolen present
Happiness is too short (If life is a gift)"
La det swinge,"From a radio old melodies flow
And I wake up and ask myself what's going on
Is this only dream and fantasies
When I feel that it's swinging more and more? Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll
Let it swing until you lose all control
Oh hi ho...
Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll Let the music live, never let the rhythm stop
Can you feel that you're alive right here and now?
Do you feel how much you want to dance?
Oh... and do you hear your heart beating on and on? Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll
Let it swing until you lose all control
Oh hi ho...
Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll Do you feel how much you want to dance?
Do you hear your heart beating on and on
And on? Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll
Let it swing until you lose all control
Oh hi ho...
Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll Let it swing, let it rock 'n' roll
Let it swing until you lose all control
Oh hi oh...
Let it swing, let it rock 'n'
Swing, let it roll 'n'
Swing, let it rock 'n' roll"
J'aime la vie,"I see people bend their backs
As if life is worth nothing
Me, I’m fifteen and I’m telling you
Whoa whoa… I love life
(I love life- life, all of life)
I too, must believe
The flashes of hope, the sleeplessness
But sum-total, addition
I love the horizon, I love, I love life
(Even if it’s crazy)
I love, I love life
(Bravo for the challenge)
I love, I love life
Don’t blame me
I’m not like that
I love, I love life
Whoa… and nevermind
If it rains too much on me
Whoa whoa… you are
Before Jacques Brel, before Mozart
I feel small, I’m depressed
I am nothing but a speck of dust
In this universe
(That’s life, life, all of life)
But say that you love me, say that you smile
My joys enchant them for infinity
There’s no more Brel, no more Mozart
My life restarts
I love, I love life
(Even if it’s crazy)
I love, I love life
(Bravo for the challenge)
I love, I love life
Don’t blame me
I’m not like that
I love, I love life
Nevermind if it rains a bit much on me
I love, I love life

I love, I love life
Don’t blame me
I’m not like that

For the days that don’t
I have something
I count on you
I love, I love life
Whoa… and nevermind
If it rains a bit much on me
Whoa whoa… life- yes, you are"
Hold Me Now,"Don’t don’t close your heart to how you feel
Dream and don’t be afraid the dream’s not real
Close your eyes pretend it’s just the two of us again
Make believe this moment’s here to stay

Touch touch me the way you used to do
I know tonight could be all I’ll have with you
From now on you’ll be with someone else instead of me
So tonight let’s build this memory for the last time

Hold me now don’t cry don’t say a word just
Hold me now and I will know though we’re apart
We’ll always be together forever in love
What do you say when words are not enough

Time time will be kind once we’re apart and
Your tears tears will have no place in your heart I wish
I I could say how much I’ll miss you, when you’re gone
All my love for you will go on and on and

Hold me now don’t cry don’t say a word just
Hold me now and try to understand
That I hope at last you’ve found what you’ve been searching for
And though I won’t be there anymore I will always love you
(Hold me now don’t cry)

Don’t say a word just hold me now and I will know though
We’re apart we’ll always be together forever in love
What do you say when words are not enough
What can I say now my words are not enough"
Ne partez pas sans moi,"You who seek the star
You who live a dream
You, heroes in the space
In the heart, bigger than the earth
Give me the chance
Take me far from here Do not leave without me
Let me follow
You who fly to other cities
Let me live
The most beautiful adventure
The most beautiful journey
Which leads one day
To suns
To the planets of love You the new poets
You the magic birds
You, you might find
New music
You, give me a chance
I want to sing along Do not leave without me
Let me follow
You who fly to other cities
Let me live
Blue of infinity
The joy of being free
On rays, on suns On songs, on wonders
And in sky of love
Blue of infinity
The joy of being free
You who seek these other lives
You who fly towards the year 2000
Do not leave without me"
Rock Me,"Oh... whoa oh oh oh... He was playing on his piano all day

Insieme: 1992,"With you, so far and different
With you, a friend that I thought I’d lost
You and I, having the same dream
Together, unite, unite, Europe And for you, a woman without borders
With you, under the same flags
You and I, under the same sky
Together, unite, unite, Europe We’re more and more free
It’s no longer a dream and you’re no longer alone
We’re higher and higher
Give me your hand, so that we can fly
Europe is not far away
This is an Italian song for you
Together, unite, unite, Europe For us, in heaven a thousand violins
For us, love without borders
You and I, having the same ideals, mmm…
Together, unite, unite, Europe We’re more and more free
It’s no longer a dream and we’re no longer alone
We’re uniting more and more
Give me your hand and you will see you’re flying
Europe is not far away
This is an Italian song for you
Together, unite, unite, Europe We’re more and more free

Fångad av en stormvind,"Uh-huh yeah
Woh-ho-ho-oh I have never stopped believing
That after every night a new dawn waits
Though I can not understand
There is time for laugher as I begin once again Feeling the smell of a silent ocean
And suddenly I'm standing in the middle of a windstorm I am captured by a windstorm
Caught on you
Nothing here can stop me
When it's windy in my heart
Captured by a windstorm
Night and day
Here is only you and me
And the light the sky has left behind It's time to leave
Because times that have pass will not return
Traveling on open seas
Where everything's like new
In the future that you hold Without regrets I leave my safe harbor
Free but still tied to a set of open arms I am captured by a windstorm
Caught on you
Nothing here can stop me
When it's windy in my heart
Captured by a windstorm
Night and day
Here is only you and me
And the light the sky has left behind We walk together
Joined by the ribbons of love
My longing wakes
When you smile, and reacher out your hand I am captured by a windstorm
Captured by a windstorm
(Caught for you)
Nothing here can stop me
When it's windy in my heart
Captured by a windstorm
Night and day
Here is only you and me
And the light the sky has left behind (Captured by a windstorm)
I am captured by a windstorm"
Why Me?,"Sometimes I watch you passing by my window
And sometimes I watch you passing through my dreams
And sometimes, when I look at you
You take my breath away

Sometimes I try and understand your reasons
You choose to feel the way you feel about me
And sometimes, when I turn around
And you're there, like today
I wanna say:

Why me?
I look at you and I get to feeling
Why me? (Why me, whooh)
I know it's true but I can't believe it
I keep on wondering why
My love shines in your eyes
Why me?
I look at you and I ask myself
Why me?

Sometimes I lie awake and watch you sleeping
And listen to the beating of your heart
And sometimes, when you're lying there
You take my breath away
And I wanna say

Why me?
I look at you and I get to feeling
Why me? (Why me, whooh)
I know it's true but I can't believe that it's me
Who's gonna be holdin' you in my arms tonight
And why it's me
Who's gonna be the one to make you feel all right
Tonight

Why me?
I look at you and I get to feeling
Why me? (Why me, whooh)
I know it's true but I can't believe it
I keep on wondering why
My love shines in your eyes
Why me?
I look at you and I ask myself
Why me?"
In Your Eyes,"Showing no emotion
My feelings locked inside
I made myself an island
Trying to take my heart and hide

I built a wall around me
Afraid of letting go
But suddenly an open door
I never saw before

In your eyes
I see the light
Leading me home again
It's heaven in your arms, my love
My heart is in your hands
In your eyes
Seems so right
I see forever in your smile
This woman is a child again
(In your eyes)

Love's been building bridges
Between your heart and mine
I'm safe here on my island
But I'm out on the edge this time
I built a wall around me
Thought I'd save myself the pain
Your touch swept me away
Now I'll never play it safe again

In your eyes
I see the light
Leading me home again
It's heaven in your arms, my love
My heart is in your hands
In your eyes
Seems so right
I see forever in your smile
This woman is a child again

I've never been this close
How do I know love will survive?
I'm walking a tightrope
Here in your arms I'm alive

I'm in your eyes
I see the light
I see forever in your smile
This woman is a child again

I'm in your eyes
I see the light
I see the light
Whoa...
I see forever in your smile
This woman is a child again
When I look in your eyes"
Rock 'n' Roll Kids,"I remember '62
I was sixteen and so were you
And we lived next door,
On the avenue.
Jerry Lee was big and Elvis too;
Blue jeans and blue suede shoes,
And we never knew
What life held in store.
We just wanted to rock 'n' roll forever more.

We were the Rock 'n' Roll Kids
And Rock 'n' Roll was all we did
And listening to those songs on the radio;
I was yours and you were mine
But that was once upon a time,
Now we never seem to Rock 'n' Roll anymore.

Now Johnny's in love with the girl next door,
And Mary's down at the record store,
They don't want to be... Around us no more.
""Golden Oldies"" but we hardly speak
Too busy running to a different beat
Hard to understand, we were once like them.
How I wish we could find those Rock 'n' Roll days again.

We were the Rock 'n' Roll Kids
And Rock 'n' Roll was all we did,
And listening to those songs on the radio;
I was yours and you were mine,
But that was once upon a time,
Now we never seem to Rock and Roll anymore.

I was yours and you were mine
That was once upon a time,
Now we never seem to Rock and Roll...

We just never seem to Rock and Roll anymore."
Nocturne,"Let day have
it's rest now
and night will wake over it
Nocturne See the darkness must
At one point end
So the night can give birth to a day"
The Voice,"I hear your voice on the wind
And I hear you call out my name

""Listen my child,"" You say to me,""I am the voice of your history
'Be not afraid come follow me. Answer my call and I'll set you free.""

I am the voice in the wind and the pouring rain
I am the voice of your hunger and pain
I am the voice that always is calling you
I am the voice, I will remain

I am the voice in the fields when the summer's gone;
The dance of the leaves when the Autumn winds blow
Ne'er do I sleep throughout all the cold Winter long
I am the force that in Springtime will grow

I am the voice of the past that will always be;
Filled with my sorrows and blood in my fields
I am the voice of the future
Bring me your peace
Bring me your peace and my wounds they will heal

I am the voice in the wind and the pouring rain
I am the voice of your hunger and pain
I am the voice that always is calling you
I am the voice

I am the voice of the past that will always be
I am the voice of your hunger and pain
I am the voice of the future
I am the voice
I am the voice
I am the voice
I am the voice"

Take Me to Your Heaven,"[Verse 1]
Shadows dancing slowly on my wall
Moonlight painting silver to the
Sound of heartbeat
Magical emotions take control
Knowing we will meet before the night is over

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I gonna make you mine
Love you till the end of time

[Chorus]
Take me to your heaven
Hold on to a dream
Take me to your heaven
When my nights are cold and lonely
Flying high together
On a journey to the stars
Won't you take me to your heaven, to your heart

I can feel your body next to mine
Reaching for a kiss that keeps me warm and tender
Seven steps to heaven, show the way
When I'm there I give myself the sweet surrender

Then I gonna make you mine
Love you till the end of time

Take me to your heaven
Hold on to a dream

So will you be my one and only
When nights are lonely
Hold on time forever

Fly on the Wings of Love,"In the summernight, when the moon shines bright
Feeling love forever
And the heat is on, when the daylight's gone
Still happy together

There's just one more thing I'd like to add
She's the greatest love I've ever had

Fly on the wings of love
Fly baby fly
Reaching the stars above
Touching the sky

And as time goes by, there's a lot to try
And I'm feeling lucky
In the warmest sand, smiling hand in hand
Love is all around me

I Wanna,"I'd like to go away, but it's easier to stay
That you know all the tricks that make that make stay
I`m ready to support this art-full game you always play
'Cause you don`t know the fee which you will later, later pay

Today you think you are the winner
Today you think you are the king
You make me sweat in my emotions
Under your fly-away, fly-away wing

I wanna be the sun-shine in your arms
I wanna be the light from shooting stars
I wanna be the Queen in your sweet lies
I wanna be the love-spark in your eyes

I like a simple game, but it`s just easier to say
That you own all that rules your crazy, crazy way
And even through you`ll go like to do what ever what ever you may
Just remember it`s me who finds you when, when you was stray

Today you think you are the winner
Today you think you are the king
You make me sweat in my emotions
Under your fly-away, fly-away wing

I wanna be the sun-shine in your arms
I wanna be the light from shooting stars
I wanna be the Queen in your sweet lies
I wanna be the love-spark in your eyes"
Everyway That I Can,"[Verse 1]
I feel you moving on a different course
Making a way for a distant cause
You say you love me and you roll your eyes
Turn to stare at the empty skies
I thought it was over and we passed all that
All we've done is to pass back to frame number one
Come on, now, now
I want to show you all again what it would be like
If you just let go and let me love you

[Chorus]
Every way that I can
I'll try to make you love me again
Every way that I can
I'll give you all my love and then
Every way that I can
I'll cry, I'll try
Make you mine again

[Verse 2]
Hold me closer, oh, so good
You make me feel just like I should
I know what you're thinking: uhuh good
Now the rest of the world is overruled
Tell me what you see in other girls all around
Come on closer and tell me what you don't find here
Come on, now, now
I want to be the everything you've been missing out
Just let go and let me love you

[Chorus]
Every way that I can
I'll try to make you love me again
Every way that I can
I'll give you all my love and then
Every way that I can
I'll cry, I'll try
Make you mine again

I'm in love with you
I'll do all you want me to
You make me want to huhuh

I'm in love with you
I'll do all you want me to
You make me want to huhuh
Make me want to huhuhuh

Every way that I can
I'll cry, I'll try
Make you mine again"
My Number One,"[Verse 1]
You're my lover, undercover
You're my sacred passion and I have no other
You're delicious, so capricious
If I find out you don't want me I'll be vicious
Say you love me and you'll have me
In your arms forever and I won't forget it
Say you miss me, come and kiss me
Take me up to heaven and you won't regret it

You are the one, you're my number one
The only treasure I'll ever have
You are the one, you're my number one
Anything for you 'cause you're the one I love

You're my lover, undercover
You're my sacred passion and I have no other

[Verse 2]
You're a fire and desire
When I kiss your lips, you know, you take me higher
You're addiction, my conviction
You're my passion, my relief, my crucifixion
Never leave me and believe me
You will be the sun into my raining season
Never leave me and believe me
In my empty life you'll be the only reason

You are the one, you're my number one
The only treasure I'll ever have
You are the one, you're my number one
Anything for you 'cause you're the one I love

Anything for you 'cause you're the one I love

You're my lover, undercover
You're my sacred passion and I have no other"

Molitva (Молитва),"I'm wide awake
An empty bed drives my dreams away
Life melts like ice
Disappears in the twinkling of an eye I'm losing my mind,
Pushing reality out of sight
Our lips are touching softly
You're the one I believe blindly I walk around like crazy
Falling in love frightens me
Days are like wounds
Countless and hard to get through Prayer.It burns my sore lips like a fire
Prayer.Thy name is something I admire
Heaven knows just as well as I do
So many times I have cried over you
Heaven knows just as well as I do
I pray and live only for you I can't lie to God
As I kneel down and pray
You're the love of my life
That's the only thing I can say"
Believe,"[Verse 1]
Even when the thunder and storm begins
I’ll be standing strong like a tree in the wind
Nothing’s gonna move this mountain or change my direction
I’m falling off the sky and I’m all alone
The courage that’s inside is gonna break my fall
Nothing’s gonna dim my light within

[Pre-Chorus]
But if I keep going on
It will never be impossible
Not today...

[Chorus]
‘Cause I’ve got something to believe in
As long as I’m breathing
There is not a limit to what I can dream
‘Cause I got something to believe in
Mission to keep climbing
Nothing else can stop me if I just believe
And I believe in me

[Verse 2]
Even when the world tries to pull me down
Tell me that I can ,try to turn me around
I won’t let them put my fire out, without no

[Pre-Chorus]
But if I keep going on
It will never be impossible
Not today...

[Chorus]
Yes, I got something to believe in
As long as I’m breathing
There is not a limit to what I can dream
‘Cause I got something to believe in
Mission to keep climbing
Nothing else can stop me if I just believe
And I believe

[Bridge]
I can do it all
Open every door
Turn unthinkable to reality
You see, I can do it all and more

[Post-Bridge]
Believe in, as long as I’m breathing
There is not a limit to what I can dream

[Outro-Chorus]
Believing, mission to keep climbing
Nothing else can stop me if I just believe
And I believe in me"
Fairytale,"[Verse 1]
Years ago, when I was younger
I kinda liked a girl I knew
She was mine and we were sweethearts
That was then, but then it’s true

[Chorus 1]
I’m in love with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
’Cause I don’t care if I lose my mind
I’m already cursed

[Verse 2]
Every day, we started fighting
Every night, we fell in love
No one else could make me sadder
But no one else could lift me high above
I don’t know what I was doing
When suddenly, we fell apart
Nowadays, I cannot find her
But when I do, we’ll get a brand-new start

[Chorus 1]
I’m in love with a fairytale
Even though it hurts
’Cause I don’t care if I lose my mind
I’m already cursed

[Chorus 2]
She’s a fairytale, yeah
Even though it hurts
’Cause I don’t care if I lose my mind
I’m already cursed"
Fairytale,"[Verse 1]
This tale of love
Larger than dreams
It may take a lifetime
To understand what it means
So many tears
All the craziness and rage
Tale of love, love
The message is love can bring change

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause it's you, only you
You I feel
And I, oh I
I know in my soul this is real

[Chorus]
And that's why I love you, oh oh
Yes I love you, oh oh
And I'd fight for you, give my life for you
My heart

[Verse 2]
But comes a day when it's not enough
What you have, and the time is up
But it's hard to turn a new page
In this tale, sweet tale of love
You will find peace in your heart
That you crave

[Bridge]
Oh oh oh oh ohoh oh
Ohoh oh ohoh
Oh oh oh oh ohoh oh
Ohoh oh ohoh

And I'd fight for you, give my life for you
My heart"
Satellite,"[Verse 1]
I went everywhere for you
I even did my hair for you
I bought new underwear, they're blue
And I wore 'em just the other day
Love, you know I'd fight for you
I left on the porch light for you
Whether you are sweet or cruel
I'm gonna love you either way

[Chorus]
Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love
Like a satellite, I'm in an orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your love

[Verse 2]
Love, I got it bad for you
I saved the best I have for you
You sometimes make me sad and blue
Wouldn't have it any other way
Love, my aim is straight and true
Cupid's arrow is just for you
I even painted my toenails for you
I did it just the other day

[Chorus]
Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love
Like a satellite, I'm in an orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your
Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love

[Bridge]
Where you go, I follow
You set the pace, we take it fast or slow
I follow in your wake
Oh, oh, oh
You got me, you got me
A force more powerful than gravity
It's physics, there's no escape

[Pre-Chorus]
Love, my aim is straight and true
Cupid's arrow is just for you
I even painted my toenails for you
I did it just the other day

[Chorus]
Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love
Like a satellite, I'm in an orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your love
Love, oh, love
I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I
Can't go a minute without your love

[Outro]
Love, oh, love
Love, love, love"

Only Teardrops,"[Verse 1]
The sky is red tonight
We're on the edge tonight
No shooting star to guide us

[Pre-Chorus]
Eye for an eye
Why tear each other apart?
Please tell me why
Why do we make it so hard?

Rise Like a Phoenix,"[Verse 1]
Waking in the rubble
Walking over glass
Neighbors say we’re trouble
Well that time has passed
Peering from the mirror
No, that isn’t me
Stranger getting nearer
Who can this person be

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You wouldn't know me at all today
From the fading light, I fly

[Chorus]
Rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes
Seeking rather than vengeance, retribution
You were warned
Once I'm transformed, once I’m reborn
You know I will rise like a phoenix
But you're my flame

[Verse 2]
Go about your business
Act as if you’re free
No one could have witnessed
What you did to me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Cause you wouldn’t know me today
And you have got to see
To believe
From the fading light, I fly

[Chorus]
Rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes
Seeking rather than vengeance, retribution
You were warned
Once I'm transformed, once I’m reborn

[Bridge]
I rise up to the sky
You threw me down but
I'm gonna fly

[Chorus]
And rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes
Seeking rather than vengeance, retribution
You were warned
Once I'm transformed, once I’m reborn
You know I will rise like a phoenix
But you’re my flame"
Heroes,"[Verse 1]
Don't tell the gods I left a mess
I can't undo what has been done
Let's run for cover
What if I'm the only hero left
You better fire off your gun, once and forever
He said go dry your eyes and live your life like there is no tomorrow, son
And tell the others to go sing it like a hummingbird
The greatest anthem ever heard

[Chorus 1]
We are the heroes of our time
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
We are the heroes of our time
Hero-oh-o-o-oes. o-uh-o-o-oh
We're dancing with the demons in our minds
Hero-uh-o-o-o
O-oh-o-o-oh
We are the heroes of our time
Hero-oh-o-o-oes, o-uh-o-o-oh
We're dancing with the demons in our minds
Hero-oh-o-o-oes, o-uh-o-o-oh

[Verse 2]
The crickets sing a song for you
Don't say a word, don't make a sound
It's life's creation
I make worms turn into butterflies
Wake up and turn this world around in appreciation
He said I never left your side
When you were lost I followed right behind
Was your foundation
Now go sing it like a hummingbird
The greatest anthem ever heard

[Chorus 1]
We are the heroes of our time
Hero-uh-o-o-oes, o-uh-o-o-oh
We're dancing with the demons in our minds
Hero-oh-o-o-oes, o-uh-o-o-oh
(We keep dancing with the demons)
(You could be a hero)

[Bridge]
Now go sing it like a hummingbird
The greatest anthem ever heard
Now sing together

[Chorus 2]
We are the heroes of our time
(Hero-oh-o-o-oes. o-uh-o-o-oh)
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
(Hero-oh-o-o-oes. o-uh-o-o-oh)
We are the heroes of our time
(We keep dancing with the demons)
(You could be a hero)
Hero-oh-o-o-oes. o-uh-o-o-oh
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
(We keep dancing with the demons)
(You could be a hero)
Hero-oh-o-o-oes. o-uh-o-o-oh

We are the heroes"
1944,"[Verse 1]
When strangers are coming
They come to your house
They kill you all

Amar pelos dois,"If one day someone asks about me
Say that I lived just to love you
Before you, I only existed
Tired and without a thing to offer My dear, listen to my prayers
I ask you to come back, that you come back to love me
I know we can't love alone
Maybe little by little you can learn again My dear, listen to my prayers
I ask you to come back, that you come back to love me
I know we can't love alone
Maybe little by little you can learn again If your heart doesn't wish to do so
To feel the passion, If it doesn't want to suffer
Without making plans about what will happen
My Heart can love for the both of us"

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on
